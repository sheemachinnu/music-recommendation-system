"I broke and fell in Your arms in such a way
Like a leaf falls from a tree carelessly
You broke me but I finally got united with You
You took away everything of mine
I had no worries, shame or care for even a moment
In every cell of mine, there’s a desire to see You
In every cell of mine, there’s a desire to see You
It is limitless and infinite.
Today I feel love for you again
Today I feel love for you again
It is limitless and infinite.You are my carefreeness
You are my evening prayer
You are reasonlessly essential to me
You are my desire yet you are missing
And you are that quest whom1
These chain of events brought to me.
Your lips are expressing (something)
Your lips are expressing (something)
It is limitless and infinite.",4
"Woh oh oh oh
 
It's not easy, over here, to fall in love
It's like aligning thorns on one's eyelashes
What lover gets out of this is just sorrows
Not everyone can explore this treasure
 
Woh oh oh oh
 
Beyond those talks, beyond those promises,
Just try to look beyond for once
It's like a flame, like fire
It's like ashes
 
Woh oh oh oh
 
You keep running behind the body
Try to go deep into the soul
Who's a lover, What's love;
Only then will you be able to know
 
Woh oh oh oh",2
"You are my journey
And you are my destination
To live without you,
O heart, is tough
 
You are my God
And you are in my prayers
To live without you,
O heart, is tough
 
Your absence tests me
For every deficit do I need you
It's my passion to become
Good enough for you
To live without you,
O heart, is tough
 
My soul is not mine
My body does not belong to me
As much as it
Belongs to you
 
Even if I have received
Only pain from you
As I have received it from you
It is a reward for me
 
My sky searches your earth
For every deficit do I need you
 
If not on earth
Meet me in the sky
 
To live without you,
O heart, is tough
 
I agree that my life is
Lacking your presence but
My heart does not know
Any other way to live
 
If you wish
You can stay unaware
Of the strength with which I love you
 
My one-sided journey
Is not dependent on destination
This journey is even more gorgeous than destination
For every deficit do I need you
 
Even though I'm incomplete
My love is complete
 
To live without you,
O heart, is tough
 
There's nothing like the power of unrequited love
Unlike other bonds, it isn't shared
It's mine, and mine alone
 
O heart, it's tough...",3
"The girl of heart is in Egypt
 
At your service my lord,
I present to you all of this beauty
At your service my lord,
I present to you all of this beauty
With these seductive desirable gestures
With these seductive desirable gestures
will burn your
veil of tearful eyes
(that is, my beauty will make you forget all your sorrows )
 
The girl of heart is in Egypt (2 times)
 
Liquored lips have started to feel
the thirst of closeness
The amazement has driven away
the pain of separation
 
On my cheeks write down
The progress and the results of my love",1
"Alright, I'm leaving now.
Please remember me in your prayers,
keep the taste of my name
on your tongue...
 
Keep my good deeds
in the box of your heart,
and also keep my greetings
in the letters and telegrams.
 
I have taken your darkness upon myself,
and named my bright shining star to you.
Oh my moon,
Oh my, my moon,
Oh my beloved moon..
Oh my beloved.
 
Although I'm no longer in your gatherings,
there is no sadness,
there is no sadness..
stories of ours of our closenesses,
aren't any less,
aren't any less
so many times I have turned
my mornings into evenings sitting in your presence.
 
Oh my moon,
Oh my, my moon,
Oh my beloved moon..
Oh my beloved.
 
I'm turning away from your path and leaving,
Just like the sandalwood, leaving my fragrance with you...
Leaving my heart's desire under your pillow.
covering myself in a simple cotton cloth as I take my leave.",2
"There is no other Punjabi (belonging to Punjab state of India) girl in the village, like you,
Why do you keep staring out of the window; come out in the open.
 
Oh Bride! Your fantastic style rules the social media.
She holds the phone in her left hand, while there is mehendi (paste to make colorful designs on the body) on her right hand.
 
You dont care about your boyfriends and bid them goodbye on the very first date;
Poor boyfriends dip into sadness and you smile with an innocent face
Cutiepie...
 
With red ribbon tying your hair and twisting your waist,
You put everyone's heart in a critical condition.
You arouse feelings in the heart and kill with a glimpse of your tattoo.
 
There is no other Punjabi (belonging to Punjab state of India) girl in the village, like you,
Why do you keep staring out of the window; come out in the open.
 
You wear fragrance/ perfume at parties, a way to lure the guys,
This is your usual way.
You wear fragrance/ perfume at parties, a way to lure the guys,
This is your usual way.
 
You put the mind and soul into a rythm,
And play the flute without touching it.
Its fine to make guys loose their sleep,
But why don't you spare the old folks?
 
You dont care about your boyfriends and bid them goodbye on the very first date;
Poor boyfriends dip into sadness and you smile with an innocent face
Cutiepie...

"For you only, breaking all signals
I came here, leaving my girlfriend from Delhi..
 
The wink of your eye looks like a fraud to me..
By God, you look like a fake useless lover to me..
 
Making promises, and saving my pocket money,
I have come here, with some savings for you only..
 
I have said bye-etc to my folks,
and come here, leaving my girldfriend from Delhi..
 
For you only, breaking all signals
I came here, leaving my girlfriend from Delhi..
 
O what a look, what a grace
I chase you only..
What a great face, what beautiful eyes,
The heart has become a fan of yours..
What a smile and what a style,
Sometimes soft and sometimes rude, I love your attitude..
 
I have begun to roam your street also,
I have written my heart in your name..
I have begun playing the games of love with you,
Now I have become a complete loverboy..
 
Today, now itself I boycott you..
I'll note all your mischieves
and report you in the police station..
 
Don't fight like that,
I'll show you the scenes of Gol mal [the film]
and make your mood light..
 
I got your name only written on the wedding card,
and come here, leaving my girlfriend from Delhi..
Go away, liar! as if for me you broke all the signals
and came here, leaving your girlfriend from Delhi..",1
"I've seen the moon
I've seen the glowing stars
But I haven’t seen anyone like you
 
I don’t want to live
unless I am submerged in your eyes
No one can stop me now
from falling in love (with you)
 
I've lost my heart, I've lost it
I've lost my heart, I've lost it
I've lost my heart, I've lost it
I've lost it to you
 
I've lost my heart, I've lost it
I've lost my heart, I've lost it
I've lost my heart, I've lost it
I've lost it to you
I've lost it to you
mmm.. o o.. oo..
mmm.. o oo..
 
With eyes wide open
I saw a beautiful dream, you
Like that sweet talk
which enters the heart, you (x2)
 
The intoxication of your name
is spread on my tongue now
I couldn't stop myself
from drowning in it
 
I've seen flowers
I've seen fragrant scenes
But I haven’t seen anyone like you
 
I don't want to live
without being scattered (embraced) in your arms
No one can stop me now
from falling in love (with you)
 
I've lost my heart, I've lost it
I've lost my heart, I've lost it
I've lost my heart, I've lost it
I've lost it to you
 
I've lost, I've lost my heart

"Ae Yeah… Nae Yeah… Ae Eah Yeah…
Ae Yeah… Yeah Yeah… Hey Yeah…
 
My heart keeps asking me this every moment
Why am I so faithful to You?1
Why my desire for You is greater than any other wish of mine?
Why do my lips utter only Your name?
Why do I have deep yearning/passion to become Your partner
I want to drink every single teardrop of Yours and give away all my comfort(for You)
I desire You every single day, I gaze upon Your path all the time
I want to keep You safe in my arms
 
I talk only about You now
You’ve had such an effect upon me
I don’t need any advice or instruction (from anyone)
My soul has selected You
Why do I have deep yearning to become Your partner?
I want to drink every single teardrop of Yours and give away all my comfort
I desire You every single day, I gaze upon Your path all the time
I want to keep You safe in my arms
 
My heart is worried without any reason
May someone come and calm it
To sacrifice oneself in it, is a custom of love
If there’s a quality of patience in it, then it isn’t true love
O my heart! Please make me understand this mystery
Why do I have deep yearning to become Your partner?
I want to drink every single teardrop of Yours and give away all my comfort
I desire You every single day, I gaze upon Your path all the time
I want to keep You safe in my arms
 
Ae Yeah… Nae Yeah… Ae Eah Yeah…
Ae Yeah… Yeah Yeah… Hey Yeah…",2
"Why is the life just a moment or two,
for this love, centuries aren't enough..
So let me ask God
for some more time, anew,
I have to live just here,
I have not to go away from you..
Now that you are there to share my pain1,
Now that you share my pain,
Every pain is beautiful,
Now that you share my pain..
 
Your smiles are my strength,
I got hope from them only.
Whatever atrocity the world does to me,
in them [these smiles] is my safety..
My life became very beautiful,
now where else would heaven be..
 
Now that you share my pain
Now that you share my pain
Every pain is beautiful,
Now that you share my pain..
 
My life is from your heartbeats,
your wishes are my prayers now..
what a unique bond it is,
that your and my life have become one..
I'll come back to you only..
It's my promise, even if I die..
 
Now that you share my pain
Now that you share my pain
Every pain is beautiful,
Now that you share my pain..
 
Hmmm.. You're my sympathizer...",4
"Listen cruel one
I am not afread
That world will understand
 
You are crazy
I am crazy also
Disease of love is great
Disease of love is great
 
Listen to me beloved
Are you aware
 
Listen to me beloved
Are you aware that
Where your breath flows
I will stay there during whole life
I will stay there during whole life
 
Your talks are more beautiful
Than this meeting
If I lose in your talks once
I can't come to conscious again
My life is in your arms haaye",2
"Evenings, as if they're mad,
nights like some tunnel..
I don't know why on rebel flights only,
O God, my heart comes..
O God, my heart is interested..
 
There is a question about tomorrow,
[as in, no one knows what happens tomorrow]
Living life is now.
I don't know why in nomadic ways only
I find my heart interested, O Lord,
my heart is interested..
 
My philosophy is - my bag is on my shoulders.
I go wherever the path takes me..
Not on the drops,
But the sea of drops itself..
 
O God, O God.. O God..",1
"Have a blessed love & sorrow
 
I'm drenched by the shower of your love
I'm flowing with you
Everything is moving besides me
This has never happened to me before
 
O my heart, congrats you're in love
 
Have a blessed love with sorrow
 
I'm still in that moment
When I saw you for the first time
I want a place in your heart
And I want to keep living there only
 
I am wandering around somewhere
Please help me find myself
 
O my heart, congrats you're in love
 
Have a blessed love & sorrow!",1
"I stopped when I reached your doorstep My eyes became spiritual Merging into each other, We became an aayat of love

What sort of liking of heart is this? You have become a verse of my soul Both of us were a bit empty Now both of us are a bit filled

Today I am saying it clearly It’s a small thing I love you

I do not give my life for you without any reason It’s a small thing I love you

Sunlight does not feel necessary Shade does not feel necessary Love meets on earth Now only two names are necessary Mine and yours

We shall have a God We shall create a world for ourselves We shall live this life You and me 

I and you are here, what else do I ask of God? Should I give my heart or life? Tell me what do I give? Our relationship is delicate that breath

There has never been, nor will be anyone like us It’s like two hearts in a single chest You and me

It’s like we both are one life You and me

I love you more than life, beloved Every moment I have lived you

"May the heart share its convoluted talks/thoughts with me also
Then it will be an act of benevolence
It will be an act of benevolence
May it understand it first itself and then make me understand
Then it will be an act of benevolence
It will be an act of benevolence
 
It will be an act of benevolence if the heart promises
To tell me what it hasn’t ever said
I’m Yours in the same manner as You are mine
I’m Yours in the same manner as You are mine
 
If we keep on meeting in this way
May the evil eye of love not see us
O deceiving/cheating heart! Why have You stopped beating
After having such wayward thoughts
 
Now it is not under my control
As the heart has come and stopped on You
I’m Yours in the same manner as You are mine
I’m Yours in the same manner as You are mine
As You are mine
Hey… Oo… Ee… Na Na… Yeah…
Mehar, Mehar, Meherbani Ho
 
It will be an act of benevolence
 
I complain and then I remember
I think about You again and again
There isn’t any love, yet why do I still desire
That You always be around me
 
There’s nothing, still there’s something
After meeting You, the heart feels
I’m Yours in the same manner as You are mine
I’m Yours in the same manner as You are mine
As You are mine
As You are mine
As You are mine
As You are mine
 
It will be an act of benevolence
As You are mine
As You are mine",4
"To whom to ask, why is it so,
this world is, as if mute..
 
Where to find moments of joy,
Even time is like without a sign..
 
There are complaints on so many lips, there are many distances from the life.. Why do the dreams dampen in eyes, when the line leaves these hands, for no reason.
 
The wish I had sent,
that collided with the sky such that a call has come back..
 
where have the breaths turned their face,
I don't see any path..
where has the heartbeat left the heart,
and where have these bodies left (their) shadows
 
I, here, think this again and again..
a smoke of memories is walking with me.
 
The wish I had sent,
that collided with the sky such that a call has come back..",2
"Sometimes when clouds cry with rain
I look deep into your eyes
As if you had answered my prayer about the first rain
 
I'm always by your side
I may look crazy to myself
But should you be my curse or bliss - we'll share it all, my love and friend
 
There's no one closer than me
You are everything I long for
Come and wipe out the distance between us
Let some part of me belong to you
Look deep into my inner self and realise
Who I really am
 
You never used to upset me
Why am I left om my own now?
The moments of love we've been through
Implied you were mine
Then why have you changed so much?
Why is it so?
 
Sometimes when clouds cry with rain
I look deep into your eyes
As if you had answered my prayer about the first rain
 
I'm always by your side
I may look crazy to myself
But should you be my curse or bliss - we'll share it all, my love and friend",4
"You're mine, at this very moment you're mine
But tomorrow it may not be this way
 
Should something go wrong you won’t be your present self
Should something go wrong I won’t be my present self
 
Should our roads fork
We’ll get lost on the way
 
And yet I would love you all the same
And yet I would love you all the same
And yet I would love you all the same
 
Should it be so, I’d rather die
And yet I would love you all the same",2

The sun has set mates

Ask me for anything

Raste bhula do saare sansaar ke
Forget the way to your home and abode.
 
No idea of the whereabouts of anybody
That is what this moment tell us
 
No idea of the whereabouts of anybody
That is what this moment tell us
 
That we can depend upon our own ideas
Even when we are breathless

Even if we don't know where to
Let's not walk, let's fly
Even if we don't know where to
So, even without an address
let's maintain a distance from the world
and a bit distance from ourselves
The sun has set mates
Have a peg or two
Forget the way to your home and abode.
 
The sun has set mates
Have a peg or two
Forget the worries of this mundane world
 
Ask me for anything
I can give you everything
Ask me for anything
I can give you everything",1

You meeting me is a sign

Don't leave tonight, the rainy season is here,

They left me
Left him
His black deeds
Broke his wallet
They left me
Left him
 
With a heavy heart
I did my makeup
Oh with a heavy heart
I did my makeup
I broke up with my beloved today
I broke up with my beloved today
I did all of this when I woke up in the morning
I broke up with my beloved today
 
When did you do all of this without telling me?
Hey, when did you do all of this without telling me?
You broke up with your beloved today
You broke up with your beloved today
 
I did all of this when I woke up in the morning
I broke up with my beloved today
 
Ba ba.. breakup song
 
I cried for a few days
Then I deleted his number
The tears dried, then I went straight to the parlour
I went to the parlour and shampooed fiercely
 
I caught up with my college friends
Hey, I caught up with my college friends
When I did not find them, I whatsapped them
 
I broke up with my beloved today
I did all of this when I woke up in the morning
I broke up with my beloved today
 
[King]
Look baby, I think that whatever you did was very, very right
Forget the past, the future coming is very, very bright
 
I am with you, baby
We have all night to party
Don't mind me if I talk too much
Because I am drunk
 
Ring his phone and give him abuse
Burn the photo and keep it
And call him an ass
 
The moment your beloved left you,
the cupid within you surfaced
Remove the old relationship label
and tell the world that you are available
 
You woke up my slumberous desires
Hey, you woke up my slumberous desires
 
With your beloved today
Oh. you broke up with your beloved today
You broke up with your beloved today
 
Ba ba.. breakup song

Sometimes like pain, sometimes pale, My life was without any name Some desires showered kindness And came forward to hold my hand
The one eye is present in my soul such that For the first time a tale was created from a single incident I have found my shelter in your arms
The words which I thought were useless, Became a necessity It’s good that some decisions of fate were made
Every moment is changed, There is an inebriation over me everywhere Love was a stranger, It is with me for the first time

But the desire of love has not gone
Not just once, but this heart has been broken a hundred times
But the desire of love has not gone
 
These smiling faces
Are hiding dark secrets
Every face here is false
 
I complain to You God
I complain to You God, It's unfaithfulness again
It's difficult to get free, Yes in Your Love
I complain to You God, It's unfaithfulness again
It's difficult to get free, Yes in Your Love
Yes in Your Love
 
You can't escape my love...
 
Yes it is my fault that You got this
I ask only this: Why did You Love?
Why did You Love?
Where is Love nowadays anywhere
If we spend a few moments in Love now
Then what is the whole life worth
It doesn't listen to any talk
Just believe that Life has only one meaning
Love is the only religion
If there is no Love then even the God is angry
 
I complain to You God, It's unfaithfulness again
Its difficult to get free, Yes in Your Love
I complain to You God, It's unfaithfulness again
It's difficult to get free, Yes in Your Love
 
Yes You are regardless of the world
I am also regardless, then why any veil from me
Yes if there was a veil then would any heart fall for it
I prayed for love not to happen
I prayed for love to happen, I took punishment
I have understood that this is a huge burden
I tried to stop this heart a lot, but it going once again to get cheated
This heart is broken because of its own nature
 
I complain to You God, It's unfaithfulness again
It's difficult to get free, Yes in Your Love
I complain to You God, It's unfaithfulness again
It's difficult to get free, Yes in Your Love
 
Yeah I'm coming back to the race
Tell me if you're ready!
Can you take the pace?
This time wanna make you see
Ain't nobody gonna play game like me

You loose when you call the die
Just gonna chew and make you see
Make you see...
Ain't nobody gonna run a race like me",1

Limitless...
Love me in such a way, without any limits..
 
Do some effrontery..
and some I do, in such a way,
that even the two shadows that we see here,
feel shy and turn their faces the other way..
 
You have touched this body
Now kiss my soul too..
Why are my words all drenched
Being all broken, being helpless,

why are my feelings all drenched
Two unaware drenched bodies,
two impatient drenched bodies
are turning all night..

To my sighs too

The one who smiles looking at me
To whom I want to make mine, day 'n night
God, assign her to me

What do you stand to loose
I have not asked you for paradise
What kind of God are you?
You might only be a name afterall
that you can't even deliver my asking
What I need
please handover to me
May your lineage rejoice
May my love live long
Just give me my life

The story of my heart, oh, the story of my heart.

And I have fallen for him now
He left me lovelorn, craving for him

Now the heart desires what's on the lips of this silence
I’d write a list of lovely words
May she write a few of her moments to my name, and so will I do the same
And write many a rendezvous, too
In the first sight, she took my breath away
And her eyes are embossed on this heart of mine
Where’d I go now, the heart stops at her’s
Where she saw me and went ahead on her way
And I have fallen for him now
He left me lovelorn, craving for him
And I have fallen for him now
He left me lovelorn, craving for him

Or is she the breezes herself
Like the sunny days in a winter, she’s the warm evening
She’s like those first rains
She’s the weather of my love, she’s my God as well

When you burned the last letter from me
When you took the flowers out of the books,
You must have remembered who gave them to you

As well as separate
It was necessary
That we completed our desires
But it was also necessary
For them to spill
It was necessary
For the river of your eyes to flow
 
Tell me you remember
When you had stolen my heart
You had made that stolen item
The home of God
When you used to say
That you read my name in prayers
You feared missing
The prayer of love
But now I remember it and know
That they were mere talks
It was necessary to go back
On your words
It was necessary
For the river of your eyes to flow
 
Our faces are the same,
You are the same and so am I
But I am lost somewhere,
So are you
We have been disloyal in love,
We were and are non-believers
We have attained our destinations
But still are travellers
I wandered a lot after being cast
Out from your heart
But when I wandered I realized
That to wander was also necessary
It was necessary to love
As well as separate it was necessary
It was necessary
That we completed our desires
But it was also necessary
For them to spill
It was necessary
For the river of your eyes to flow",2

"Why don’t you go

Everyone is asking about You
That where is the bride of Badri?
 
I’ll apply colour on Your dress
Tell me which colour, blue or red?
Your hair is flying in the air
Let me colour both Your cheeks

My gaze has tangled with Yours (Your gaze)

"Fire flows through your veins

first one means ""to captivate""
second one means ""to consolidate""
third one means ""to destroy"")
 
(Lyricist define Lord Shiva as)
 
he can never be created nor destroyed
he is equal for everyone
he is the one in which the world strings like pearls
he is serene & rejoices his own space
 
He knows everything about magic & talismans
He knows everything & respects his pride
He can dismantle anything & deathless
He speaks the language of 'Omkar' (The sound of sacred syllable)
 
Marijuana & dhatura are hoisted to him
He is the king of all the three lok's (hell,earth & heaven)
He is immortal even after drinking poison as well
He is the lord of universe who chants har har
 
He is zero & absolute
In whom Lord Shiva resides
 
This is Aghor mantra
(if someone repeats it regularly
He becomes equal to dues)
 
My salutations to the letter “Na” , which is Shiva
Who wears as garland the king of snakes
Who has three eyes
Who wears ash all over Him
Who is the greatest Lord
Who is forever
Who is the cleanest
And who wears the directions themselves as dress
 
Shiv protect us save us
 
Shiv protect us save us
Only you can guard us
 
He can see anything with eyes shut
He is playing with time
He is only great lord
For him this whole universe is minuscule
 
The holy river Ganges tied in his hair with moon as his crown
He can be loving and sometimes horrendous
He came in existence through fire and lives in Kailash mountain
He is more energetic then the energy itself
 
Ram & Ravan belongs to him
He can take or give life
He can be chaotic & forgiving
He teaches the way of life to everyone
 
When he opens his third eye(mounted on his forehead)
The earth & heaven shakes
His name echoes in every direction and on the horizon

In whom Lord Shiva resides
 
He is zero & absolute

Who has a tufted hair,
Who is armed with spear,
Who is forever filled with peace,
Who is godly,
Who is the great God,
And who wears the directions themselves as dress.",3

She was famous throughout the world for her beauty.
Their story is what everyone calls Om Shanti Om.

That he would find in her, love in all its splendour.
He didn’t realize how foolish he was,
He thought the sand was water.

By giving her heart to a merciless man, betrayed by him, she met her end one day.
The story of this injustice is what everyone calls Om Shanti Om.

A crime cannot be hidden,
The stain cannot be erased,
It remains on his hands.
When that beautiful girl was murdered,
Someone was there to help her
But he couldn’t save her,
His love cried on her death.
The story goes that the one who recognizes the murderer, that lad has come back.
It’s life’s way of telling the murderer that the shadow of death has surrounded him.

He talks in eyes only
silently, whispering..
He dives in the river of dreams
(sounds of diving/sinking/bubbles)
 
the mellow Barfi has come..
Barfi is a blister in the foot
Barfii is the light of nights
being silent only, he is upto mischieves
mischievous, he does that non-stop.
 
....
.... Oh God, save me from him
 
He talks in eyes only...
He dives in the river of dreams...
 
He never stops
He never stays
Whenever he sees sorrow
he kicks it with happiness
 
The harmonium of his eyelids (which keep going up and down all the time like a harmonium's air-filler)
He, on the rhythm of heartbeats
keeps on singing lovely songs
 
Don't consider him innocent
He is a very clever player
He will extinguish the sun
such a blow he will give
in the yard, the pond, under the Peepal tree,
He leaves no street..
 
He talks in eyes only...
He dives in the river of dreams...
 
Barfi was sleeping in mother's womb,
The mother ordered the radio of Murphy
The Murphy kid was mother's dream child
When the child came in this world slowly
The father set the station of Ceylon
 
The radio was switched on
The mother got turned off (she died)
Every dream ended
The child sheds tears mute only
The child cannot listen to the rattling toy",1

Come here, come here...x2

The nervous heart too
is saying that without you

I won't live, I will die without you.
I won't live, I will die without you.
I won't live, I will die without you.
I won't live, I will die without you",2

My traditional girl,
My traditional girl
girl girl girl girl (x2)
 
She drops her earring,
And if she meets your eye, she'll destroy your sight.
 
And if she dances,
Everybody's heartbeats beat in sync with her feet.
 
She lays her trap by her oceanic walk,
Making your heart a sorry state
All the romantics agree
They've never seen a girl like that
 
Never seen a girl like that
 
(Chorus)
I've seen a million foreign women,
But ain't nobody like my traditional girl.
 
I've seen a million foreign women,
But the most beautiful and simple is my traditional girl.
 
Who's the hottest girl in the world,
My traditional girl,
My traditional girl.
 
By the jerk of her waist, she'll rock your world
My traditional girl,
My traditional girl.
 
My traditional girl,
My traditional girl.
 
If your eye falls upon her waist,
All your dreams will be filled with colour
 
If she takes your hand
Lovers will lose their lives just smiling,
No matter where you look in the world,
You'll never find a girl like this.
 
I've seen a million foreign women,
But ain't nobody like my traditional girl.

My traditional girl,
My traditional girl.
 
My traditional girl,
My traditional girl.
 
(Female part)
Wherever I go,
All the eyes follow me
If I just stop for a moment,
All those cold breaths stop dead.
Everybody's eyes say
That they've dreamt of a girl like me,
A girl like me.
 
(Chorus)
I've seen a million foreign women,
But ain't nobody like my traditional girl.
 
I've seen a million foreign women,

One not of the earth
You are a cloud and yet you've yet to bring rain

If I ever stop, I do not linger
I simply take the grass upon my wings
There is no nest for me
 
A gust blew me out of my leafy tree
It blew me about like a dry leaf
 
Come, come to me
O come to me just this once
Let's rise from this earth
We shall place our feet upon the breeze
Fly for just a bit
 
Let's go where there are no paths or roads
 
Let's go where there is no one at all
 
It is said that such a place exists only in the eyes

When I found you
It was as if I'd met myself
 
We were silent
But we had spoken with life itself
 
Come, come to me
O come to me, let us sit for a while
Hand in hand
Without saying a word
 
Let us probe the silences of the eyes
 
How quiet it is to whisper
 
I am told it is forever so in the world of our eyes
