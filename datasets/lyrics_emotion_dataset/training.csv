"Where was God when I needed a friend?

And where was God when I came to an end?

Where was God when I lost my mind?

Where was God when I can find?

I don't wanna be up or down

Don't wanna be up or down

Don't wanna be up or down

I don't wanna be up or down

Where was love when I felt like hate?

Where was hate when I felt like love?

Where were you

when you said you'd be there?

Where was the fear
when I said I was scared?

I don't wanna be up or down

Don't wanna be up or down

Don't wanna be up or down

I don't wanna be up or down

Tell me what you believe

I'll tell you what you should see

Cause I don't know who to trust

My heart is filled with disgust

I can't take this! no

Tell me what you believe

I'll tell you what you should see

Cause I don't know who to trust

My heart is filled with disgust

Tell me what you believe

Tell me what you believe

Ladies and gentlemen

May I have your attention

Are you ready for the joke

Are you ready for the great deception

Tell me what you believe

Tell me what you believe

Tell me what you believe

Tell me what you believe

Tell me what you believe

Tell me what you believe

"We skipped the light Fandango
Turned cartwheels 'cross the floor
I was feeling kind of seasick
But the crowd called out for more
The room was humming harder
As the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink
The waiter brought a tray

And so it was that later
As the Miller told his tale
That a face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

She said there is no reason
And the truth is plain to see
But I wandered through my playing cards
And would not let her be
One of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast
And although my eyes were open
They might just as well've been closed

And so it was later
As the Miller told his tale
AThat a face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale

And so it was later
As the Miller told his tale
That a face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale
A whiter shade of pale
Turneda whiter shade of pale
A whiter shade of pale",2

Have you heard it on the news
About this fascist groove thang?
Evil men with racist views
Spreading all across the land
Don't just sit there on your ass
Unlock that funky chaindance

We don't need this fascist groove thang

Brothers, sisters

History will repeat itself
Crisis point, we're near the hour
Counterforce will do no good
White blue eyes, I feel your power
Hitler proves that funky stuff
It's not for you and me, girl (no, no, no)
Europe's an unhappy land
They've had their fascist groove thang

Brothers, sisters
We don't need their fascist groove thang
Brothers, sisters

Democrats are out of power
Across that great wide ocean
Reagan's president elect
Fascist God in motion
Generals tell him what to do
Stop your good time dancing
Train their guns on me and you
Fascist thang advancing

Sisters, brothers lend a hand
Increase your population
Grab that groove thang by the throat
And throw it in the ocean

You're real tonight, you move my soul
Let's cruise out of the dance war
Come out your house and dance your dance
Shake that fascist groove thang (shake it)

"Lo! The darkness has casted in parts.
That thy star has sparked.
Come to the sky and write down signature.
So far thou were imperfect.
Now thou are to be perfect.
Thou shall transgress while doing transgression.
If where there is a will there is a way.
Learn it well.
If there is impossibility so what;
Thou determine it.
 
It is thy turn, get set.
All issues are nothing than thy ambition.
In the lands of thy broken heart;
Yield the fields of courage.
 
Thy mercy is in thy hands.
And thy blood is hot.
Even an arrow shall not miss from the target.
Keep the steps roughly.
 
Thou are a weapon in yourself.
And ready to fight.
Like hitting the nail on the head.
Every of thy ictus.
The destination is a fan of thou.
The God is thy protector.
Do something that even He may question thee.
Bondman, what is your consent?
 
Ward off every darkness of dread.
Thou become power, become fronter.
Prove it wear out to every destination.
Repeat the story of Arjun.
 
Thy ointment shall forbidden.
And the injury shall thy gift.
That is wetted in thy sweat.
That very shall the aspect of victory.
 
Though it is on the floor.
Thy fete is to win.
While separating from every relationship.
Thou transfer yourself for the destination.
This thing shall be discussed.
With everyone's tongues.
How the God has created;
Thy both hands by melding swords.",1
"One day when I came home at lunchtime I heard a funny noise
Went out to the back yard to find out if it was one of those rowdy boys
Stood there with my neighbor called Pete  and a Flux Capacitor
He told me he built a time machine
Like one in a film I've seen
Yeah he said
I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed but they lived under water
And your great great great grand daughter
Is doing fine (doing fine)
He took me to the future in the flux thing, and I saw everything
Boy bands  and another one and another one and another one
Girls there with round hair like Star Wars float above the floor
We drove around in a time machine
Like the one in the film I've seen
Yeah he said
He said  I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed but they lived under water
And your great great great grand daughter
Is doing fine (she's doing fine)
I took a trip to the year 3000
This song had gone multi-platinum
Everybody bought our 7th album
It had outsold kelly clarkson
I took a trip to the year 3000
This song had gone multi-platinum
Everybody bought our 7th album

He told me he built a time machine
Like the one in a film I've seen
Yeah
I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed but they lived under water
And your great great great grand daughter
Is doing fine (doing fine)

He said  I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed but they lived under water
And your great great great grand daughter
Is doing fine (doing fine).
He said  I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed but they lived under water
And your great great great grand daughter
Is doing fine (she's doing fine)
He said I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed but they lived under water
And your great great great grand daughter
Is doing fine ( doing fine)

"I'm goin' home, gonna load my shotgun
Wait by the door and light a cigarette
If he wants a fight well now he's got one
And he ain't seen me crazy yet
He slap my face and he shook me like a rag doll
Don't that sound like a real man
I'm going to show him what a little girls made of
Gunpowder and lead
It's half past ten, another six pack in
And I can feel the rumble like a cold black wind
He pulls in the drive, the gravel flies
He dont know what's waiting here this time
I'm goin' home, gonna load my shotgun
Wait by the door and light a cigarette
If he wants a fight well now he's got one
And he ain't seen me crazy yet
He slap my face and he shook me like a rag doll
Don't that sound like a real man
I'm going to show him what a little girls made of
Gunpowder and lead
His fist is big but my gun's bigger
He'll find out when I pull the trigger
I'm goin' home, gonna load my shotgun
Wait by the door and light a cigarette
If he wants a fight well now he's got one
And he ain't seen me crazy yet
He slap my face and he shook me like a rag doll
Don't that sound like a real man

"I broke into your house last night 
And left a note at your bedside 
I'm far too shy to speak to you at school 
You leave me numb, and I'm not sure why 

I find it easier to sit and stare 
Than push my limbs out towards you right there 
My heart is bursting in your perfect eyes 
As blue as oceans and as pure as skies 

I struggle for the words and then give up 
My head's up with the birds on the T hut 
A little peace of mind that I know better 
Than the plain disgrace of all my letters 

But after that the floodgates opened up 
And I fell in love with everyone I saw 
Please take your time, I'm not in any rush 
And it's in everything I ever write 

It's not as if I need the extra weight 
Confused enough by life, so thanks a lot 
Lonely written words for company 
Just raise the roof this once and follow me 

I struggle for the words and then give up 
My head's up with the birds on the T hut 
A little peace of mind that I know better 
Than the plain disgrace of all my letters",1
"We're in the building where they make us grow
And I'm frightened by the liquid engineers
Like you

My mallory heart is sure to fail
I could crawl around the floor just like I'm real
Like you

The sound of metal
I want to be
You
I should learn to be a man
Like you

Plug me in and turn me on
Oh, everything is moving here

I need my treatment
It's tomorrow they send me
Singing ""I am an American""
Do you?

Picture this
If I should make the change
I'd love to pull the wires from the wall
Did you?

And who are you?
And how can I try?
Here inside I like the metal
Don't you?",2
"From the black of decieving lies
A new star is born now he brings you to light

Hey, nothing you can say (say),
nothing gonna change what you've done to me
Now it's time to shine (shine),
I'm gonna take what's mine
While you're burning inside my light

I gave and you take
And I waited for you but I made a mistake
It's clear that you're fear is so near me
Because I see the look on you're face

You tried to hold me under, I held my breath
Alone and now you wonder, What I posess

Hey, nothing you can say (say),

"I'm bleeding ya
bleeding in ways of the fire burned
I'm crying ya
crying in ways of the nightbird
No more is there one to lay by my side
I'm straying ya
straying in nightmares all the time

A little something I know
A little somewhere I go
reminds me of you

To blossom blue,
is to blossom without you
To blossom blue,
I'm breaking breaking but I cannot bear to
I'm staring staring but I cannot see you
For no more are you to lay by my side
I'm weeping no more then this second time

A little something I know
A little somewhere I go
Where the sweet waters flow, reminds me of you

A little something I know
A little somewhere I go
Where the sweet waters flow
Where the mistletoes grow,
reminds me of you

To blossom blue,
 is to blossom without you

"X and Y
The land, sea, rivers, trees, the stars, the sky
That and this
We're part of a bigger plan
Don't know what it is
Don't know what it is

You and me
The land, sun, trees, the sky, the stars, the sea
365 degrees
I am a puzzle, you're the missing piece
Hang on a minute, just a minute, please
I'll come
And everything under the sun
And everything under the sun

What is this feeling that I can't explain?
And why am I never gonna sleep again?
What is this thing I've never seen before?
A little boy lost in a breaking storm
Pilots up and away they fly
To write your name in the summer sky
Life has really only just begun
Life that comes
And everything under the sun

X is Y
The land, sea, rivers, trees, the stars, the sky
365 degrees
All of the surface and the underneath
Searching your mellow and outsings your key, ah
And everything under the sun
And everything under the sun

What is this feeling that I can't explain?
And why am I never gonna sleep again?
What is this thing I've never seen before?
A little boy lost in a breaking storm
Pilots up and away they fly
To write your name in the summer sky
Life has really only just begun
Life that comes
And everything under the sun

And you don't know that you've been born
Can't see the calm until the storm
Can't tell your right side from your wrong
Can't see the wave you're riding on",4
"I don't know where I'm at
I'm standing at the back
And I'm tired this waiting
Waiting here in life
Hoping that I'll find
What I've been chasing

I shot for the sky
I'm stuck on the ground
So why do I try
I know I'm gonna fall down
I thought I could fly
So why did I drown
Never know why
It's coming down, down, down

I'm not ready to let go
'Cause then I'd never know
What I could be missing
But I'm missing way too much
So when do I give up
What I've been wishing for

I shot for the sky
I'm stuck on the ground
So why do I try
I know I'm gonna fall down
I thought I could fly
So why did I drown
Never know why
It's coming down, down, down

Oh I'm going down, down, down
I can't find another way around
And I don't wanna hear that sound
Of losing what I never found

I shot for the sky
I'm stuck on the ground
So why do I try
I know I'm gonna fall down
I thought I could fly
So why did I drown
I'll never know why
It's coming down, down, down

I shot for the sky
I'm stuck on the ground
So why do I try
I know I'm gonna fall down
I thought I could fly
So why did I drown
Oh, it's coming down, down, down

"So it's Halloween
And you feel like dancing
And you feel like shining
And you feel like letting loose 

What ya gonna be?
Babe, you better know
And you better plan
Better plan all day

Better plan all week, better plan all month
Better plan all year

You're dressed up like a clown
Putting on your act
It's the only time all year
You'll ever admit that

I can see your eyes, I can see your brain
Baby, nothing's changed
I can see your eyes, I can see your brain
Baby, nothing's changed

Because you're hiding in a mask
You take your fun seriously
No, don't blow this year's chance
Tomorrow your mold goes back on

After Halloween 
After Halloween

You go to work today
You'll go to work tomorrow
Shitfaced tonight
You'll brag about it for months

Remember what I did, remember what I was
Back on Halloween?

But what's in between?
Where are your ideas?
You sit around and dream
For next Halloween

Why not every day, are you so afraid
What will people say?
Why not every day, are you so afraid
What will people say?

After Halloween
After Halloween
After Halloween

Because your role is planned for you
There's nothing you can do
But stop and think it through

But what will the boss say to you?
And what will your girlfriend say to you?
And the people out on the street, they might glare at you
And what do you know, you're pretty self-conscious too 

So you run back and stuff yourselves in rigid business costumes
Only at night to score is your leather uniform exhumed
Why don't you take your social regulations and shove 'em up your ass?
Why don't you take your social regulations and shove 'em up your ass?

Why don't you take your social regulations and shove 'em up your ass?",3
"I think we have an emergency
I think we have an emergency
If you thought I'd leave, then you were wrong
'Cause I won't stop holding on

So are you listening?
So are you watching me?
If you thought I'd leave, then you were wrong
'Cause I won't stop holding on

This is an emergency
So are you listening?
And I can't pretend that I don't see this
But it's really not your fault
That no one cares to talk about it, to talk about it

'Cause I've seen love die way too many times
When it deserved to be alive (when it deserved to be alive)
And I've seen you cry way too many times
When you deserved to be alive, alive

So you give up every chance you get
Just to feel new again

I think we have an emergency
I think we have an emergency
And you do your best to show me love
But you don't know what love is

So are you listening?
So are you watching me?
Well, I can't pretend that I don't see this
But it's really not your fault
That no one cares to talk about it, to talk about it

'Cause I've seen love die way too many times
When it deserved to be alive (when it deserved to be alive)
And I've seen you cry way too many times
When you deserved to be alive, alive

The scars, they will not fade away

And no one cares to talk about it, to talk about it

'Cause I've seen love die way too many times

When you deserved to be alive, alive",2

Please forgive me for all the wrong I've done.
Please come back home girl.
I know you put all your trust
In me, I'm sorry I let you down.
Please forgive me girl.

Say I'm sorry
Stop pointing fingers, the blame is on me
I want a new life
And I want it with you
If you feel the same
Don't ever let it go
You gotta believe, in the spirit of love
It can heal all things
We won't hurt any more
No I don't believe our love's terminal
I'm down on my knees, begging you please
Come home


Can we go back to the days our love was strong
Can you tell me how a perfect love goes wrong
Can somebody tell me how to get things back
The way they used to be

Real life goes undefined, why must you be so missable?
Everything you take makes me more unreal
Real lines are undefined, how can this be so miserable?

You turned away

Feel fine, I kissed the lies, why must they be so kissable?
Listen as I break, break the fourth wall's seal
Gorgeous eyes shine suicide, when will we be invisible?

I burned away
Under the summer rain, burn
We burned away

Under the summer rain
I burned away
Under the summer rain, burn
You turned away

This is the fall, this is the long way down
And our lives look smaller now, and our lives look so small
This is the fall, this is the long way down
And our lives look smaller now, and our lives look so small

Under the summer rain
I burned away
Under the summer rain, burn
We burned away

Under the summer rain, burn
I burned away
Under the summer rain, burn
You turned away",2

Your mouth don't move but I can hear you speak

What's the matter with the boy?
He don't come around no more
Is he checking out for sure?
Is he gonna close the door on me?

I'm always hearing voices on the street
I want to shout, but I can't hardly speak

I was making love last night
To a dancer friend of mine
I can't seem to stay in step
'Cause she come ev'ry time that she pirouettes over me

And I only get my rocks off while I'm dreaming
I only get my rocks off while I'm sleeping

I'm zipping through the days at lightning speed
Plug in, flush out and fire the fuckin' feed

Heading for the overload
Splattered on the dirty road
Kick me like you've kicked before
I can't even feel the pain no more

But I only get my rocks off while I'm dreaming (only get them off)
I only get my rocks off while I'm sleeping (only get them off)

Feel so hypnotized, can't describe the scene
It's all mesmerized all that inside me

The sunshine bores the daylights out of me
Chasing shadows moonlight mystery

Headed for the overload
Splattered on the dirty road
Kick me like you've kicked before
I can't even feel the pain no more

But I only get my rocks off while I'm dreaming (only get them off, get them off)
I only get my rocks off while I'm sleeping (only get them off, get them off)
And I only get my rocks off while I'm dreaming (only get them off, get them off)

"Let's dance in style,
Let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait,
We're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best
But expecting the worst
Are you going to drop the bomb or not
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power
But we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit,
Life is a short trip
The music's for the sad men
Can you imagine when this race is won??
Turn our golden faces into the sun
Praising our leaders,
We're getting in tune
The music's played by the madmen
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever
Forever and ever
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever
Forever young

Some are like water
Some are like the heat
Some are a melody and some are the beat
Sooner or later, they all will be gone
Why don't they stay young?
It's so hard to get old without a cause
I don't want to perish like a fading horse
Youth's like diamonds in the sun
And diamonds are forever
So many adventures couldn't happen today
So many songs we forgot to play
So many dreams swinging out of the blue
We'll let them come true
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever
Forever and ever
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever
Forever and ever
Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever

Swore upon the sun
I'd save you for a rainy day
Loosen the noose & let go of the rope

I know if it's never coming back it has to go

keep callin' your name

I wanna hold you close
but I never wanna feel ashamed

So I keep callin' at night, keep callin' at night

I wanna hold you close I just never wanna hold you tight

Callin' you, Callin' you up
just to keep crawlin' into your arms
Goodness gracious I can't seem to stop

Callin' you, Callin' you up just to
keep crawlin' into your arms

I found the weakness & put it to play

Swore upon the stars
I'd keep you til the night was day
Shake my head dizzy so I'll never know

You said if you're never comin' back you have to go
I keep callin' your name,
keep callin' your name

I wanna hold you close

So I keep callin' at night,

Scan the graveyard

It was round about midnight. Hipster town. Imagine going for a walk.
Things get around to taking place. It's not a waste of time.
The rich got a little poorer.
Things get around to taking place if they're gonna happen at all.
Don't need that jazz. Don't need that stuff.
It was round about midnight. Hipster town.

"Something always brings me back to you.
It never takes too long.
No matter what I say or do
I'll still feel you here 'til the moment I'm gone.

You hold me without touch.
You keep me without chains.
I never wanted anything so much than to drown in your love
and not feel your rain.

Set me free, leave me be.
I don't want to fall another moment into your gravity.
Here I am and I stand so tall,
just the way I'm supposed to be.
But you're on to me and all over me.

Oh You loved me 'cause I'm fragile.
When I thought that I was strong.
But you touch me for a little while
and all my fragile strength is gone.

Set me free, leave me be.
I don't want to fall another moment into your gravity.
Here I am and I stand so tall,
just the way I'm supposed to be.
But you're on to me and all over me.

I live here on my knees as I try to make you see that
you're everything I think I need here on the ground.
But you're neither friend nor foe though I can't seem to let you go.
The one thing that I still know is that you're keeping me down
Hu~
keeping me down... yeah yeah yeah
But you're on to me on to me and all over me
Something always brings me back to you.
It never takes too long...

"Walking around, looking down
For something better
There's nothing better
Same old weird and familiar sound
It's just you leaving town, my God
August came around

Summer comes and
Leaves you with a fever
That you caught
When you were young
Summer goes, makes you feel
Like life is great
And hanging on for more

Empty streets, empty me
Just call me vagabond
Wondering in the sun
This is getting sort of old
Wandering aimlessly
Is it empty streets, or empty me?

Summer comes and
Leaves you with a fever
That you caught
When you were young
Summer goes, makes you feel
Like life is great

And hanging on for more

Hanging, hanging
Holding on for more, hoping, praying,
This will all start over
Come back for me
We will walk the streets
Of this old town
Make me a promise
This will all come back around

Summer comes and goes and leaves you
(You wanted more)
It comes and goes and leaves you

Summer comes and
Leaves you with a fever
That you caught
When you were young
Summer goes, makes you feel
Like life is great
And hanging on for more.

Hanging on for more.",2

Met her on the mountain
Stabbed her with my knife

Hangin' from a white oak tree

"I hope this old train breaks down
Then I could take a walk around
And, see what there is to see
And time is just a melody
All the people in the street
Walk as fast as their feet can take them
I just roll through town
And though my windows got a view
The frame im looking through
Seems to have no concern for now
So for now

Let me please breakdown

This engine screams out loud
Centipede gunna crawl westbound
So I don't even make a sound
Cause it's gunna sting me when I leave this town

If these tracks don't bend somehow
And I got no time
That I got to get to

Let me please breakdown
I need this here
Old train to breakdown

But I cant stop now
Let me break on down
But you cant stop nothing
If you got no control
Of the thoughts in your mind
That you kept in, you know
You don't know nothing
But you don't need to know
The wisdoms in the trees
Not the glass windows
You cant stop wishing
If you don't let go
But things that you find
And you lose, and you know
You keep on rolling
Put the moment on hold
The frames too bright
So put the blinds down low
I need this here
Old train to breakdown
Oh please just
Let me please breakdown
I need this here
Old train to breakdown
Oh please just
Let me please breakdown

How could you give your heart to him?

And that I do admit, yes,
But sometimes lovers go astray,
But you made it permanent.

I can take the pain of infidelity,
But I can't take you with him.

Ooh so girl what I gotta do to make you see
I mean what I say to you
I'll send you a picture
Let you know I miss ya
Girl send me a kiss
I can't wait to see ya

Every minute every second
Every hour of the day Iyiyi
Every hour of the day Iyiyi
Everytime that I'm away Iyiyi
Missing You, missing You
Every moment that is stolen
It can never be replaced Iyiyi
Even if it's for a day Iyiyi
I'm a text you up to say Iyiyi
Missing You, missing You

Lil mama ain't nobody else I need you girl Iyiyi
Got intentions just to please you girl and I try Iyiyi
Lady that's what you deserve, superfly Iyiyi
Be more precious than a pearl I can't lie Iyiyi
Pictures in my living room when I ride Iyiyi
Dashboard digital to the sky Iyiyi
So thankful that you're in my world so or die Iyiyi
Baby I ain't kidding you
I don't wanna be your distant man
Tellin me I don't do enough for plans
I really can't afford to let it hit the fan
Girl every minute I wanna hold your hand
Ain't no limit to the words I'm saying
I don't wanna rock with a brand new band
Just you lil mama that's grand
I've been all over the land, and

Every minute every second
Every hour of the day Iyiyi
Every hour of the day Iyiyi
Everytime that I'm away Iyiyi
Missing You, missing You
Every moment that is stolen
It can never be replaced Iyiyi
Even if it's for a day Iyiyi
I'm a text you up to say Iyiyi
Missing You, missing You

Ohhh
Oh oh yeah oh
I'm, I'm missing you

"Well I'm about to be on the floor again
Surely you're gonna find me here
Well I'm about to sleep until the end of time
Drug I take gonna wake my fear right now

I'm passing away onto the better life
I'm passing away onto the better

Well I'm about to see just how far I can fly
Surely you're gonna break my fall
Well I'm about to run as fast as I can
Headlong into that wall this time

I'm passing away onto the better life
I'm passing away onto the better

Onto the better life
Onto the better

I'm about to be on the floor again
Surely you're gonna find me here
Well I'm about to sleep until the end of time
Drug I take gonna wake my fear right now

I'm passing away onto the better life
I'm passing away onto the better
I'm passing away onto the better life

"An unforeseen future nestled somewhere in time
Unsuspecting victims no warnings no signs
Judgment Day the second coming arrives
Before you see the light, you must die
Forgotten children confirm a new faith
Avidity and lust controlled by hate
The never ending search for your shattered sanity
Souls of damnation in their own reality
Chaos rampant in age of distrust
Confrontations impulsive habitat
Bastard sons beget your canting daughters
Promiscuous mothers with your incestuous fathers
Ingrate souls condemned for all eternity
Sustained by immoral observance a domineering deity
Chaos rampant in an age of distrust
Confrontations impulsive sabbath
On and on south of Heaven
On and on south of Heaven
On and on south of Heaven
On and on south of Heaven
of The root all evil is the heart of a black soul
The force that has lived all eternity
The never ending search for a truth never told
The loss of all hope and your dignity
Chaos rampant in an age of distrust
Confrontations impulsive habitat
On and on south of Heaven
On and on south of Heaven
On and on south of Heaven
On and on south of Heaven

"If I could take this moment forever
Turn the pages of my mind
To another place and time
We would never say goodbye
If I could find the words I would speak them
Then I wouldn\'t be tongue tied
Will I look them to your eyes
We would never say goodbye
If I could stop the moon ever arising
Day would not become the night
Would\'t feel this cold inside
And we\'d never say goodbye
I wish that our dreams were frozen
Then our hearts would not be broken
When we let each other go
If I could steal this moment forever
Paint a picture perfect smile
So our story stayed alive
We would never say goodbye
Ahh............

"Try to remember
The kind of September
When life was slow
And though so mellow
Try to remember
The kind of september
When grass was green
And grain was yellow
Try to remember
The kind of september
When you were a tender
And callow fellow
Try to remember
And if you remember
Then follow follow
Try to remember
When life was so tender
That no one wept
Except the willow
Try to remember
The kind of september
When love was an ember
About to billow
Try to remember
And if you remember
Then follow,follow

"You should be stronger than me
You been here seven years longer than me
Don't you know you supposed to be the man
Not pale in comparison to who you think I am

You always wanna talk it through, I don't care
I always have to comfort you when I'm there
But that's what I need you to do, stroke my hair

'Cause I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy

You should be stronger than me
But instead you're longer than frozen turkey
Why'd you always put me in control?
All I need is for my man to live up to his role

Always wanna talk it through, I'm okay,
Always have to comfort you every day
But that's what I need you to do. Are you gay?

'Cause I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy

He said, ""The respect I made you earn - 
Thought you had so many lessons to learn""
I said, ""You don't know what love is. Get a grip!""
Sounds as if you're reading from some other tired script

I'm not gonna meet your mother anytime
I just wanna grip your body over mine
Please tell me why you think that's a crime

I've forgotten all of young love's joy
Feel like a lady, and you my lady boy

You should be stronger than me
You should be stronger than me
You should be stronger than me
You should be stronger than me",4
"My skin is like a map, of where my heart has been
And I can't hide the marks, but it's not a negative thing
So I let down my guard, drop my defences, down by my clothes
I'm learning to fall, with no safety net, to cushion the blow
I bruise easily, so be gentle when you handle me
There's a mark you leave, like a love heart carved on a tree
I bruise easily, can't scratch the surface without moving me
Underneath I bruise easily, I bruise easily
I found your finger prints on a glass of wine
Do you know your leaving them all over this heart of mine too
If I never take this leap of faith I'll never know
So I'm learning to fall with no safety net to cushion the blow
I bruise easily, so be gentle when you handle me
There's a mark you leave, like a love heart carved on a tree
I bruise easily, can't scratch the surface without moving me
Underneath I bruise easily, I bruise easily
Anyone who, can touch you, can hurt you, or heal you
Anyone who, can reach you, can love you, or leave you
So be gentle
So be gentle
So be gentle
I bruise easily, so be gentle when you handle me
There's a mark you leave, like a love heart carved on a tree
I bruise easily, can't scratch the surface without moving me
Underneath I bruise easily, I bruise easily
I bruise easily, so be gentle when you handle me
There's a mark you leave, like a love heart carved on a tree
I bruise easily, can't scratch the surface without moving me
Underneath I bruise easily, I bruise easily
I bruise easily

The way that it felt
To be holding on to you

When your heart is bleeding it'll heel in time,
But what if I myself am guilty of the crime,
'Cause I see

I didn't realize I had it all,
Instead I chose to take a fall,
Now it's all the same,
And I've me to blame
Now I'm left alone with my shame,
Left with all my shame

Painful whispers,
Shouting in my head,
Things that were bright yellow,
Are now black instead

I had a secret meeting with a strange desire,
I couldn't get enough it only took me higher,
Now I see

I didn't realize they had it all,
Instead I chose to take a fall,
Now it's all the same,
And I've me to blame,
Now I'm left alone with my shame

The picture of us on the window seal,
It's not replaced with dust,
And your fingerprints are gone,
And now loneliness is a friend of mine

I didn't realize they had it all,
Instead I chose to take a fall,
Now it's all the same,
And I've me to blame

I didn't realize they had it all,

Why I'm feeling so blue
Everytime I close my eyes, all I see is you
Gimme a reason
Why I can't feel my heart
Everytime you leave my side, I just fall apart

And when you're fast asleep, I wonder where you go
Can you tell me, I wanna know

Because I miss you
And this is all I wanna say
I guess I miss you, beautiful

You know I miss you
I think about you when you're gone
I guess I miss you, nothing's wrong
I don't need to carry on

Gimme a reason
Why I can't concentrate
The world is turning upside down
Spinning round and round
Gimme a reason
Why I now understand
The beauty and simplicity of everything surrounding me
You got a way of spreading magic everywhere
Anywhere I go, I know you're always there
It sounds ridiculous, but when you leave a room
There's a part of me that just wants to follow you too

Because I miss you
And this is all I wanna say
I guess I miss you, beautiful
These three words have said it all
You know I miss you
I think about you when you're gone
I guess I miss you, nothing's wrong
I don't need to carry on

It's such a hard life in most of the time
I'm just surviving
That's why I want you to know
In the world where sincerity has lost its meaning
You fill my world with so much hope

And I miss you
This is all I wanna say
I guess I miss you, beautiful

You know I miss you
I think about you when you're gone
I guess I miss you, nothing's wrong
I don't need to carry on

Sing to me and sooth the ring in my ears
Overcast these gloomy nights wear on
But I'm holding fast

Oh Annmarie, believe me, I loved you

But now those lonely lullabies
Just dampen my tired eyes
Because I can't forget you

Because I can't forget you

I'll dissolve when the rain pours in
When the nightmares take me
I will scream with the howling wind
'Cause it's a bitter world and I'd rather dream

And hung above our lids too flushed to blink
But icy blue froze the fairytale cold
Though I treasured you
And you sparkled with someone to hold

And every flower that grows on the Earth

Ressurect the intention
Once your vision is now mass-produced,
Imagine the insults a blessing
imagine accepting the truth

Imagine accepting the truth
Imagine accepting the truth
Imagine accepting the truth
Just imagine accepting the truth
Imagine accepting the truth

The pendulum swinging
Hypnosis has taken control, now you linger
on a shadow of a doubt
Have you really figured what you're all about?
Don't trust your instincts
Just open the chamber where you keep those darkest regrets
All the things you've done wrong
Rebellious at heart all along
Is your leader a voice?
Somehow you replaced all your game with a debt
Now the payback's a bitch
Why owe your life to a bitch?
Absolutely pathetic
and regret it when told you are made of mistakes
Imagine the insults a blessing
imagine accepting the truth

Imagine accepting the truth
Imagine accepting the truth
Imagine accepting the truth
Imagine accepting the truth
Imagine accepting the truth

Now speak to your leader!
Now speak to your leader!

Your father who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name,
deliver us from evil, deliver us from evil
Your father who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name,
deliver us from evil, deliver us from evil
Our father who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name,
deliver me from evil, deliver me from evil
Our father who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name,
deliver me from evil, deliver me from evil

"Fake Tales of San Francisco echo through the room
More point to a wedding disco without a bride or groom
There's a super cool band, yeah, with their trilbys and their glasses of white wine
And all the weekend rockstars in the toilets practicing their lines

I don't want to hear you (kick me out, kick me out)
I don't want to hear you, no (kick me out, kick me out)
I don't want to hear you (kick me out, kick me out)
I don't want to hear you, I don't want to hear you

Fake Tales of San Francisco echo through the air
And there's a few bored faces in the back, all wishing they weren't there
And as the microphone squeaks a young girl's telephone beeps
Yeah, she's dashing for the exit, oh, she's running to the streets outside
""Oh, you've saved me"", she screams down the line
""The band were fucking wank and I'm not having a nice time""

I don't want to hear you (kick me out, kick me out)
I don't want to hear you, no (kick me out, kick me out)
Yeah, but his bird said it's amazing, though, so all that's left
Is the proof that love's not only blind but deaf

He talks of San Francisco, he's from Hunter's Bar
I don't quite know the distance but I'm sure that's far
Yeah, I'm sure it's pretty far

And, yeah, I'd love to tell you all my problem
You're not from New York City, you're from Rotherham
So get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Get off the bandwagon, put down the handbook
Get off the bandwagon, put down the handbook
Get off the bandwagon, put down the handbook

Here in the dark
I feel electric
I sense my skin in between the waves
I am human, I am criminal
But I feel life here in my heart again
Standing in the rain
Thinking all the way
To keep these feelings inside
Walk away from here
Before the words appear
I will be silent..

Here in the dark
I feel electric
I sense my skin in between the waves
I am human, I am criminal
I hide behind the walls
So you don't notice me at all
But it hurts me so
Waiting in the wind
Whispering the things

Only for you..only for you Only you..only you

"Went to the fortune teller
To have my fortune read
I didn't know what to tell her
I had a dizzy feeling in my head 

Siad she'd take a look at my palm
She said ""Son, you feel kinda warm""
And she looked into her crystal ball
Said ""You're in love"" 

Said it could not be so
Not with all the girls I know
She said when the next one arrives
Looking into her eyes 

I left there in a hurry
Looking forward to my big surprise
The next day I discovered
That the fortune teller told me a lie 

I hurried back down to that woman
As mad as I could be
I told her I didn't see nobody
Why'd she make a fool out of me 

Then something struck me
As if it came from up above
While looking at the fortune teller
I fell in love 

Now I'm a happy fellow
Well I'm married to the fortune teller
We're happy as we can be
Now I get my fortune told for free 

Now I'm a happy fellow

In a crowd of teenagers coming out of the zoo
She stumbled, started to slip and fall
Teeter-tottered on the top of patent leather shoes
I happened to catch her and said
""Maybe these ruby shoes are a little cumbersome for you.""
Maybe for you, now

But not as shaky as I must have seemed
Talking junk through her giggle little teenage dream
And on the phone I could not compete
My dumb luck fake confidence was getting weak
And for a sec', I thought I sounded sweet
But sure enough in a gruff, faint voice
I heard myself speak

But sooner or later, I'll break your smile
And I can tell a joke
But one of these days, I'm bound to choke

And I bet we could build a home
But I know the right thing for me to do
Is to leave you alone

And say I'm doing exactly what a coward would do
And I'm beginning to like you

And so you watched me wash away
But maybe we'll catch up someday
Maybe well catch up someday
Sun sinks out of view
Stars they shine changing hue
But bright lights have blinded your sights
They cant adjust when day turns to night
And so you watched me wash away
But maybe well catch up someday
The castles we built were so tall
They only left us further to fall
And still I see them far away
But maybe we'll come back someday
Maybe we'll come back someday
Float down stream, rivers of dreams
Float down stream, catch your wings
The castles we built were so tall
They only left us further to fall
And still I see them far away
Maybe well come back someday
The castles we built were so tall
They only left us further to fall
And still I see them far away
As I watch them wash away
Wash away...
Wash away...
Wash away...
Wash away...

"I cried all the way to the altar
A smile was on my face
But tears were in my heart

Two hearts broken
And a third will soon falter
Now too late, I know that we
Were wrong to part

Oh my darlin', now too late
We can't go back and start anew
Now too late, I've thrown away
My chance of happiness with you

I cried all the way to the altar
Now too late, I know that we
Were wrong to part

Take a calendar and turn back all the pages
Take my life, turn back each day since I was born
I cried all the way to the altar
Now too late, I see the damage I have done

Oh, my darling, now too late
We can't go back and start anew
Now too late, I've thrown away
My chance of happiness with you

I cried all the way to the altar
Now too late, I know that we
Were wrong to part",2
"You should have listened to what mama said
And walked away with someone else instead
You should have listened to what grandma said
And married someone more like Fred

You should have listened to your inner voice
While you had time and still a choice
You should have reached for the emergency brake
Before it was too late

You see the clever girl looks for a clever boy
To another extent than the clever boy
Will ever look for a mate
Who goes to round-table debates
And runs a little bit late
When she does work for the state

You see the clever girls look for a clever boys
And then the clever boys seem to have a different choice
They want a good-looking chick
That likes to blow them away
Someone who laughs at all the
Funny little things they say

I have a friend who's in this MENSA club
He has no trouble to admit
He wants a woman with ambitions
That go as far as raising kids

You see the clever girl looks for a clever boy
To another extent than the clever boy
Will ever look for a mate
Who goes to round-table debates
And runs a little bit late
When she does work for the state
You see the clever girl looks for a clever boy
To another extent than the clever boy
Will ever look for a mate
Who goes to round-table debates
And runs a little bit late
When she does work for the state
You see the clever girl looks for a clever boy
To another extent than the clever boy
Will ever look for a mate
Who goes to round-table debates
And runs a little bit late
When she does work for the state",1

Now I roam around London, Paris, New York, LA, San Francisco
 
You went to find her, why didn't you?
Your dreams broken, isn't it now?
 
I requested my mind to think about you
I requested my mind not to tink about you
I am yearning for you
I never yearned like this
You went to find her, why didn't you?
Your dreams broken, isn't it now?she's my love, my darling
She left me on the 24th of last month

"Though you've played at love and lost
And sorrow's turned your heart to frost
I will melt your heart again

Remember the feeling as a child
When you woke up and morning smiled
It's time you felt like you did then

There's just no percentage
In remembering the past
It's time you learned to live again at last

Come with me, leave yesterday behind

And take a giant step outside your mind

You stare at me in disbelief
Say, for you, there's no relief
But I swear I'll prove you wrong

Don't sit in your lonely room
Just staring back in silent gloom
That's not where you belong

Come with me, I'll take you where
The taste of life is green
And every day holds wonders to be seen

Come with me, leave yesterday behind

And take a giant step outside your mind

And I know you before
you face all the doors
But if you could receive
in silence you leave
and love never knelt these nineteen
paces from me
And if I’d followed you
in an open canoe
and if I’d never liked the shirts with
stripes and the news
that I know you before
you face all the doors
that I know you before
you face all the doors

"on candystripe legs the spiderman comes
softly through the shadow of the evening sun
stealing past the windows of the blissfully dead
looking for the victim shivering in bed
searching out fear in the gathering gloom and
suddenly!
a movement in the corner of the room!
and there is nothing i can do
when i realise with fright
that the spiderman is having me for dinner tonight!

quietly he laughs and shaking his head
creeps closer now
closer to the foot of the bed
and softer than shadow and quicker than flies
his arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes
""be still be calm be quiet now my precious boy
don't struggle like that or i will only love you more
for it's much too late to get away or turn on the light
the spiderman is having you for dinner tonight""

and i feel like i'm being eaten
by a thousand million shivering furry holes
and i know that in the morning i will wake up
in the shivering cold

and the spiderman is always hungry...

"In the face of change
That's when she turned to me and said
""I'm not sure anymore...""

And now, amidst the waves and the cloudless skies
That'd blanket the year before
I watch my life wash ashore

Have you ever been a part of something 
That you thought would never end
And then of course it did?
Have you ever felt the weight inside you
Pulling away inside your skin
And then something had to give?

Now the lines are drawn
Is this feeling gone?
The best parts of this have come and gone
And now there is all this is
With the reasons clear
We'll spend another year
Without direction, full of fear
But now things will be different

There's nothing simple when it comes to you and I
There's always something in this everchanging life
And there probably always will
Now that time is getting harder to come by
The same arguments are always on our mind
We've killed this slowly fading light

Now the lines are drawn
Is this feeling gone?
The best parts of this have come and gone
And now there is all this is
With the reasons clear
We'll spend another year
Without direction, full of fear
But now things will be different

And now something 
Has kept me here too long
And you can't leave me 
If i'm already gone

Well now something (hey) 
Has kept me here too long
And you can't leave me (hey)
If i'm already gone

Now let's say that something (hey) 
Has kept me here too long
And you can't leave me (hey)
If i'm already gone

Now that we
Make the same mistakes, we're always hanging on
Break those promises we're always leaning on
All this time spent waking up
I keep this line open to get this call from you 
Speak the words
That keep me coming back to you
Now this time it's all different

Now something has kept me here too long 
And now I'm gone...",2
"It's cold outside, why don't you come in?
I know, my walls are crumbling
It's late at night, and lately I've been alone
But that could be changing

What you do to me, conjures up feelings
I've never felt before, and your company I adore
So deliciously, gold and burgundy
Sink into me I feel so warm

I feel you, I taste you
The smoothest wine
Like velvet, can't help it
This love's divine
(I'm ready to feel you)

The moon is full, the stars are aligned
I know, just look into my eyes
It's beautiful, your skin against mine
I hope, you let your mind take flight
Under velvet skies
Lover we can fly away from the world
Let all of our love unfurl
What a gorgeous ride,
You don't have to hide a thing from me, I am your girl

I feel you, I taste you
The smoothest wine
Like velvet, can't help it
This love's divine
(I'm ready to feel you)

I'm ready to feel you slowly we escape
Our time we can take, we can take, we can take
I'm ready to feel you, feel you, feel you, feel you, feel you, feel feel

I feel you, I taste you
The smoothest wine
Like velvet, can't help it
This love's divine

I feel you, I taste you
The smoothest wine
Like velvet, can't help it
This love's divine

And your strain, it gets under my skin

"We wrote a prelude to our own fairy tale
and bought a parachute at a church rummage sale

and with a mean sewing machine and miles of thread
we sewed the day above L.A. in navy and red
we roamed a racetrack through your mom's kitchen chairs
and fought the shadows back down your dark basement stairs
I lit a match then let it catch to light up the room
and then you yelled as we beheld an old maroon hot air balloon

I'll be out of my mind
and you'll be out of ideas pretty soon
so let's spend the afternoon in a cold hot air balloon
leave your jacket behind
lean out and touch the tree tops over town
I can't wait to kiss the ground wherever we touch back down

We drank the great lakes like cold lemonade
and both got stomach aches, sprawled out in the shade
swore to death, you held your breath
and I tried not to yawn
you made my frown turn upside down and now my worries are gone

I'll be out of my mind
and you'll be out of ideas pretty soon

"Everybody's got a secret
Can you tell me what is mine?
I've been waiting for something for so long
To show me the answers that I want
Reason to believe in that's so strong
But I don't think that it exists
I've been waiting for something for so long
To show me the answers that I want
Reason to believe in that's so strong
But I don't think that it exists
Yeah, give me reason to believe
This world's not a sick machine
When every where's a dead end
In every direction
Yeah, can you give me what I need
Or just sit and watch me bleed
'Cause after all
You can't get everything you want now
But all I would need is one
Thing to keep me moving on
Can you tell me what you'd find
I'll tell you if you keep it
I promise not to lie
Well, I have the fears
The pain and the tears
I just can't hide
It all disappears
'Cause everything passes with the time
All you need is reason to believe",3

Detach your life from mind control
Evade life of being ruled
Destroy
The parts that lie unused
Permanence
Eternity
Surgery
Will set you free
Vacant eyes and lack of care
Now one with humanity

Hate, pure, pure, answer,
No one ever, again, pure,
Hate, pure, children sew their
Minds shut, answer, no one ever.

Is a directive
Brain found to be
Grossly defective
The soul, it sees,
Sees through the eyes,

Drilling holes in
Trepanation

Is all we use
You need it like a hole in the head",2

But the music's been too bad
Can only sense happiness
if the music is sad

Dreams will keep me young
Old enough to stress
Only mirrors tell the time

So, I'm going home
I must hurry home
So will my life go on

Yes, I'm going home
Going home alone
And your life goes on

So, I'm going home
I must hurry home
So will my life go on

Yes, I'm going home
Going home alone
And your life goes on

But I can't see you 'cross the streamline

Goodbye (I wasn't there for you)

I can wrestle with the stormy night
Because your love lasts a lifetime

"This is what I thought you said
Talking on the phone
Just walk away
And cry
Cause so long

The holidays we spent will fade
Now that I've been gone
Just remember
That we met
You're still at home

Listen to the voice that says all right
This is start and not the end tonight

You sent an SOS away
Reach across the sky
Through glowing windows
We stare
But not at home

Times like this you wonder why
It's even worth your while
Just count the silence
These days
Until you smile

Listen to the voice that says all right
This is start and not the end tonight

Listen to the voice that says all right
This is start and not the end tonight",1
"Riding through the city on my bike all day
Cause the filth took away my licence
It doesn't get me down and I feel ok
Cause the sights that I'm seeing are priceless
Everything seems to look as it should
But I wonder what goes on behind doors
A fella looking dapper, but he's sittin with a slapper
Then I see it's a pimp and his crack whore
You might laugh you might frown
Walkin' round London town
Sun is in the sky oh why oh why ?
Would I wanna be anywhere else
Sun is in the sky oh why oh why ?
Would I wanna be anywhere else
When you look with your eyes
Everything seems nice
But if you look twice
you can see it's all lies
There was a little old lady, who was walkin down the road
She was struggling with bags from Tesco
There were people from the city havin lunch in the park
I believe that it's called al fresco
Then a kid came along to offer a hand
But before she had time to accept it
hits her over the head, doesn't care if she's dead
Cause he's got all her jewellery and wallet
You might laugh you might frown
walkin round London town
Sun is in the sky oh why oh why ?
Would I wanna be anywhere else
Sun is in the sky oh why oh why ?
Would I wanna be anywhere else
When you look with your eyes
Everything seems nice
But if you look twice
you can see it's all lies
Life, that's city life, yeah that's city life, that's city life
Life, that's city life, yeah that's city life, that's city life
Sun is in the sky oh why oh why ?
Would I wanna be anywhere else
Sun is in the sky oh why oh why ?
Would I wanna be anywhere else
Sun is in the sky oh why oh why ?
Would I wanna be anywhere else
Sun is in the sky oh why oh why ?
Would I wanna be anywhere else
When you look with your eyes
Everything seems nice
But if you look twice
you can see it's all lies
When you look with your eyes
Everything seems nice
But if you look twice
you can see it's all lies

"What do you do when you know something's bad for you
And you still can't let go?

I was naive
Your love was like candy
Artificially sweet
I was deceived by the wrapping
Got caught in your web
And I learned how to bleed
I was prey in your bed
And devoured completely

And it hurts my soul
'Cause I can't let go
All these walls are caving in
I can't stop my suffering
I hate to show that I've lost control
'Cause I, I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need to walk away from

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away

I should have known
I was used for amusement
Couldn't see through the smoke
It was all an illusion
Now I've been licking my wounds (licking my wounds)
But the venom seeps deeper (deeper, deeper)
We both can seduce
But darling you hold me prisoner (prisoner)

I'm about to break
I can't stop this ache
I'm addicted to your allure
And I'm fiendin' for a cure
Every step I take
Leads to one mistake
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need...

I can't mend
This torn state I'm in
Getting nothing in return
What did I do to deserve
The pain of this slow burn
And everywhere I turn
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need to walk away from

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya

Everytime I try to grasp for air
I get smothered in despair, it's never over, over
Seems I'll never wake from this nightmare,
I let out a silent prayer
That it be over, over

Inside I'm screaming,
Begging pleading no more

I don't know what to do
My heart has been bruised
So sad but it's true
Each beat reminds me of you

It hurts my soul
'Cause I can't let go
All these walls are caving in
I can't stop my suffering
I hate to show that I've lost control
Cause i
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need, oh

I'm about to break
And I can't stop this ache
I'm addicted to your allure
And I'm fiendin' for a cure
Every step I take
Leads to one mistake
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need, oh

I can't mend
This torn state I'm in
Getting nothing in return
What did I do to deserve
The pain of this slow burn
And everywhere I turn
I keep going right back
To the one thing that I need to walk away from

I say...
I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away

Only thing I need to do is walk away

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away

I need to get away from ya
I need to walk away from ya
Get away, walk away, walk away",2
"Through early morning fog i see
The visions of the things to be
The pains that are withheld from me
I realise and i can see

That Suicide is painless
It brings on any changes
But i can take or leave it if i please

The game of life is hard to play
I'm gonna loose it anyway
But losing cards are some days late
So this is all i have to say
Suicide is painless
It brings on any changes
But i can take or leave it if i please

The sword of time will pierce our skin
It doesn't hurt when it begins
But as it works its way on in
The pain grows stronger watch it grin
Suicide is painless
It brings on any changes
But i can take or leave it if i please
A brave man once requested me

To answer questions that i keep
""is it to be or not to be""
And i reply ""oh why ask me ?""
Suicide is painless
It brings on any changes
But i can take or leave it if i please
And you can do the same thing if you please

"I got away in the morning light
After staying awake all night
I saww that man standing by the sea
I'm coming back here anyway

*Well I want to do good
But I've been doing wrong
I do what I do but I don't understand it
I see and I hear
But I don't know what you demand of me*

A gentle way can save a life
You looked away and opened my eyes
But I remember every word I spoke
It still cuts like a sharpened knife

*Well I want to do good
But I've been doing wrong
I do what I do but I don't understand it
I see and I hear
I was old from the start

"The words flow
Decisions made
Idea's mine
But the inspiration not
Dreams of hangers-on
Dreams of getting well
Spells of esmeralda
Amarose fortold

Splinters in the eye
Sentiments remain
Bones are never asked
Where are we going to
It was never up to me
And yet I pushed until it broke

I love the open road
And all that it suggests
Wheelwagon dust
Weeds and infidelities
And always swore our love
Never questioned why
In a wooden house
Immovable and silent
And drinking strawberry wine
Forever lost in town

And through the sleeping streets
Nightbound and heavy
Wheels in a spoke
Just a spoken foreign sound

Know my gates are high
My friends even higher
Forgotten in my mind
Yet the scars still lingering
Cloud the blue skies
I'm jealous of you birds
Was the only truth
In a world full of words

Hear the prairie sound
In a friend called Neil
The heart is pointed down
But my spirit pointed up
His voice the siren
Of greek mythology

I pause with my pen
I begin to defend
Every action taken
Every moment sealed
When I was quick
It coursed through open veins
The will to live
The urgency to move
Behind a panel door
Sealing cherry stain
I played my guitar
And lived those lonesome notes

Like a dog that's down
In a corner just aside
Waiting to be called
Waiting to be yours
Ghosts of a machine
Without purpose or will

I'll often speak of you
But the you was always me
'Cause when I speak of me
It's me I ask of you
So let there be no truth
Just trickery in rhymes
Time the only thing
Waiting still is death

I hope for resolution
Pray one defining moment
Pause without restraint
Barren without child
A child is who I was
A child is who I'll die
A child is who I'll die

Soot in my hair
And stars in my hands
Soot in my hair
And stars in my hands
Soot in my hair
And stars in my hands",2
"(Patterson)

Innocence and irony,
A a dark shade of fantasy as the serpent slips right into me
Living out your fallacy,
I'm just another casualty of casual insanity.

Summers white cause the sun has gone,
But it won't be long till tomorrow comes and you're on the run with what you've taken.
Knowing what I should have known, I'm staring at the telephone,
And I think our god has been and gone, but I'm still waiting.

I've a solution. a final solution",2
"Yo, all I need is one mic, one beat, one stage
One nigga front, my face on the front page
Only if I had one gun, one girl and one crib
One God to show me how to do things his son did
Pure, like a cup of virgin blood; mixed with
151, one sip'll make a nigga flip
Writin names on my hollow tips, plottin shit
Mad violence who I'm gon' body, this hood politics
Ackowledge it, leave bodies chopped up in garbages
Seeds watch us, grow up and try to follow us

One knee I ducked, could it be my time is up
But my luck, I got up, the cop shot again
Bus stop glass bursts, a fiend drops his Heineken
Richochetin between the spots that I'm hidin in

This is my hood I'ma rep, to the death of it
'til everybody come home, little niggaz is grown
Hoodrats, don't abortion your womb, we need more warriors soon
Sent from the star sun and the moon
In this life of police chases street sweepers and coppers
Stick-up kids with no conscience, leavin victims with doctors
IF YOU REALLY THINK YOU READY TO DIE, WITH NINES OUT
THIS IS WHAT NAS IS BOUT, NIGGA THE TIME IS NOW!

Yo, all I need is one mic..
All I need is one mic.. that's all I need
All I need is one mic.. all I need niggaz
All I need is one mic.. yeah

All I need is one blunt, one page, and one pen
One prayer - tell God forgive me for one sin
Matter fact maybe more than one, look back
at all the hatred against me, fuck alla them
Jesus died at age 33, there's thirty-three shots
from twin glocks there's sixteen apiece, that's thirty-two
Which means, one of my guns was holdin 17
Twenty-seven hit your crew, six went into you
Everybody gotta die sometime; hope your funeral
never gets shot up, bullets tear through the innocent
Nothin is fair, niggaz roll up, shootin from wheelchairs
My heart is racin, tastin revenge in the air
I let the shit slide for too many years, too many times
Now I'm strapped with a couple of macs, too many nines
If y'all niggaz really wit me get busy load up the semis
Do more than just hold it explode the clip until you empty
There's nothin in our way - they bust, we bust, they rust, we rust
Led flyin, feel it?  I feel it in my gut
THAT WE TAKE THESE BITCHES TO WAR, LIE 'EM DOWN
CAUSE WE STRONGER NOW MY NIGGA THE TIME IS NOW!!

All I need is one mic.. that's all I need, that's all I need
All I need is one mic.. there's nuttin else in the world
All I need is one mic.. that's all a nigga need to do his thing y'know
All I need is one mic..

ALL I NEED IS ONE LIFE, ONE TRY, ONE BREATH I'M ONE MAN
WHAT I STAND FOR SPEAKS FOR ITSELF, THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND
Or wanna see me on top, too egotistical
Talkin all that slick shit, the same way these bitches do
Wonder what my secrets is, niggaz'll move on you
only if they know, what your weakness is I have none
Too late to grab guns I'm blastin cause I'm a cool nigga
Thought I wouldn't have that ass done?  Fooled you niggaz
What you call a infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin
War gets deep, some beef is everlastin
Complete with thick scars, brothers knifin each other
up in prison yards, drama, where does it start?
You know the block was ill as a youngster
Every night it was like a, cop would get killed body found in the dumpster
For real a hustler, purchased my Range, niggaz throwin dirt on my name
Jealous cause fiends got they work and complain
Bitches left me cause they thought I was finished
Shoulda knew she wasn't true she came to me when her man caught a sentence
Diamonds are blindin, I never make the same mistakes
Movin with a change of pace, lighter load, see now the king is straight
Swellin my melon cause none of these niggaz real
Heard he was, tellin police, how can a kingpin squeal?
This is crazy, I'm on the right track I'm finally found
You need some soul searchin, the time is now

All I need is one mic.. yeah, yeah yeah yeah
All I need is one mic.. that's all I ever needed in this world, fuck cash
All I need is one mic.. fuck the cars, the jewelry
All I need is one mic.. to spread my voice to the whole world

buried with our past
We used to play outside when we were young
and full of life and full of love.
Some days I feel like I'm wrong when I am right.

But I don't think Ronnie Milsap's gonna ever
Record this song

Lets go to Memphis in the meantime baby
Memphis in the meantime girl

Lets go to Memphis in the meantime baby
Memphis in the meantime girl

Maybe there's nothin' happenin' there
Maybe there's somethin' in the air
Before our upper lips get stiff
Maybe we need us a big ol whiff

If we could just get off-a that beat little girl
Maybe we could find the groove
At least we can get a decent meal
Down at the Rendez-vous

'Cause one more heartfelt steel guitar chord
Girl, it's gonna do me in
I need to hear some trumpet and saxophone
You know sound as sweet as sin

And after we get good and greasy
Baby we can come back home
Put the cowhorns back on the cadillac
And change the message on the cord-a-phone

But...

Lets go to Memphis in the meantime baby
Memphis in the meantime girl",4
"Love me love me say you do
Let me fly away with you
We are creatures of the wind

Wild is the wind

Give me more than one grasp

To satisfy this hungriness

We are creatures of the wind

Wild is the wind

You touch me

I hear the sound of mandolins

You kiss me

With your kiss my life begins

Like a leaf clings to a tree

Baby please cling to me

We are creatures of the wind

Wild is the wind

"Mic check one-two
Who woulda knew?
Who'da known?
Fuck what a story
Motherfucker comes out
and sells a couple of million records
And these motherfuckers hit the ceiling
I don't do black music, I don't do white music
I make fight music, for high school kids

I put wives at risk with a knife like this (AHHH!!)
Shit, you probably think I'm in your tape deck now
I'm in the back seat of your truck, with duct tape stretched out
Ducked the fuck way down, waitin to straight jump out
put it over your mouth, and grab you by the face, what now?
Oh - you want me to watch my mouth, how?
Take my fuckin eyeballs out, and turn em around?
Look - I'll burn your fuckin house down, circle around
and hit the hydrant, so you can't put your burning furniture out
(Oh my God! Oh my God!) I'm sorry, there must be a mix-up
You want me to fix up lyrics while the President gets his dick sucked?

Make fun of gay clubs, men who wear make-up
Get aware, wake up, get a sense of humor
Quit tryin to censor music, this is for your kid's amusement
(The kids!) But don't blame me when lil' Eric jumps off of the terrace
You shoulda been watchin him - apparently you ain't parents
Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd effect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch
I never knew I, knew I would get this big
So who's bringin the guns in this country?　(Hmm?)
I couldn't sneak a plastic pellet gun through customs over in London
And last week, I seen a Schwarzaneggar movie
where he's shootin all sorts of these motherfuckers with a uzi
I sees three little kids, up in the front row,
screamin ""Go,"" with their 17-year-old Uncle
I'm like, ""Guidance - ain't they got the same moms and dads
who got mad when I asked if they liked violence?""
And told me that my tape taught 'em to swear
What about the make-up you allow your 12-year-old daughter to wear?
(Hmm?)　So tell me that your son doesn't know any cuss words
when his bus driver's screamin at him, fuckin him up worse
(""Go sit the fuck down, you little fuckin prick!"")
And fuck was the first word I ever learned
up in the third grade, flippin the gym teacher the bird (Look!)
So read up, about how I used to get beat up
peed on, be on free lunch, and change school every 3 months
My life's like kinda what my wife's like (what?)
Fucked up after I beat her fuckin ass every night, Ike
So how much easier would life be
if 19 million motherfuckers grew to be just like me?
I never knew I.. knew I'd..
have a new house or a new car
A couple years ago I was more poorer than you are
I don't got that bad of a mouth, do I?
Fuck shit ass bitch cunt, shooby-de-doo-wop (what?)
Skibbedy-be-bop, a-Christopher Reeves
Sonny Bono, skis horses and hittin some trees (HEY!)
How many retards'll listen to me
and run up in the school shootin when they're pissed at a
teach-er, her, him, is it you is it them?
""Wasn't me, Slim Shady said to do it again!""
Damn!　How much damage can you do with a pen?
Man I'm just as fucked up as you woulda been
if you woulda been, in my shoes, who woulda thought
Slim Shady would be somethin that you woulda bought
that woulda made you get a gun and shoot at a cop
I just said it - I ain't know if you'd do it or not
How the fuck was I supposed to know?

"Screaming For Vengeance-Judas Priest

Hey listen don't you let 'em get your mind

Fill your brain with orders and that's not right

They're playing at a game that draws you closer

Till you're living in a world that's ruled by fear

Always takin' baby out that's o.k.

What they're givin' maybe it's out of phase with me
Told you once you're never gonna win the race

Same old no tomorrow kicked in the face

We are screaming for vengeance

The world is a manacled place

Screaming, screaming for vengeance

The world is defiled in disgrace

Tie a blindfold all around your head

Spin you round in the torture before the dread

And then you're pushed and shoved into every corner

Then they lead you out into the final slaughter

As the sweat is running down your neck

All your praying for's to stop you body breakin' up

Oh your heart is pumping gonna soon explode

Got to fight the horror of this mental load

We are screaming for vengeance

The world is a manacled place

Screaming, screaming for vengeance

The world is defiled in disgrace

So you wait it out and bide your time

Rip off that straight jacket gotta break that line

Everyone who wins in the great escape

Leaves a thousand more who suffer in their wake

I don't talk about it but that's alright

Table's turned now there's a revenge in sight

If it takes forever babe I tell ya I can wait

Send them screaming back through their hell's own gate

We are screaming for vengeance

The world is a manacled place

Screaming, screaming for vengeance

The world is defiled in disgrace

That it was her heart that he was stealing
He was ready to impress
And the fierce excitement, the eyes are bright
He couldn't wait to get away
And I bet that Juliet was just the icing on the cake
Make no mistake, no

And even if somehow
he could have shown you the place you wanted
Well I'm sure you could have made it
that bit better on your own

And I bet she told a million people
that she'd stay in touch
But all the little promises that don't mean much
When there's memories to be made
And I hope you're holding hands by New Year's Eve
They made it far too easy to believe
That true romance can't be achieved these days

And even if somehow

Well I'm sure you could have made it

You are the only ones who know.

You're trying your hardest
And the hardest part is letting go
Of the nights we shared
Ocala is calling and you know it's haunting
But compared to your eyes, nothing shines quite as bright
And when we look to the sky, its not mine, but i want it so

Let's not pretend you're alone tonight
(I know he's there)
You're probably hanging out and making eyes
(while across the room, he stares)
I bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor
And ask my girl to dance, and she'll say yes

Because these words are never easier for me to say
Or her to second guess
But I guess
That I can live without you but
Without you I'll be miserable at best

You're all that I hoped I'd find
In every single way
And everything I could give
Is everything you couldn't take
Cause nothing feels like home, you're a thousand miles away
And the hardest part of living
Is just taking breaths to stay

Because I know I'm good for something
I just haven't found it yet
But I need it

So let's not pretend like you're alone tonight

That I'll talk to you
And I can't speak
Been three whole days since I've had sleep
Because I dream of his lips on your cheek
And I got the point that I should leave you alone
But we both know that I'm not that strong
And I miss the lips that made me fly

So let's not pretend that you're alone tonight
(I know he's there)
You're probably hanging out and making eyes
(while across the room, he stares)
I bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor
And ask my girl to dance, and she'll say yes

Because these words are never easier for me to say
Or her to second guess
But I guess
That I can live without you but
Without you I'll be miserable
And I can live without you
But without you I'll be miserable
And I can live without you
Oh, without you I'll be miserable at best

"State the obvious
I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realized you love yourself
More that you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends
That I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, I'll tell mine
You're gay and by the way
I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck, heartbreaker
Who's really been a lie
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned
You're just another picture to burn
There's no time for tears
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
Nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's going to show you how sorry you'll be
Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck, heartbreaker
Who's really been a lie, yeah
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned
You're just another picture to burn
And if you're missing me
You better keep it to yourself
Cause coming back around here
Would be bad for your health
Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck, heartbreaker
Who's really been a lie, yeah
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard
I really, really hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck, heartbreaker
Who's really been a lie, yeah
So watch me strike a match

Just another picture to burn
Baby, burn

"Shaking your head like it's all wrong
Before you're here you're already gone
And even with the light all around you
You're all alone in the dark.
You're breaking your own heart
Taking it too far down the lonely road
You say it's just one love
But when it's close enough you just let it go
The very thing you've been the most afraid of
You've been doing it from the start, breaking your own heart.

Too many tears, too many falls
It's easy to hear behind these walls
But you don't have to walk in the shadows
Life is so hard.
You're breaking your own heart
Taking it too far down the lonely road
You say it's just one love
But when it's close enough you just let it go
The very thing you've been the most afraid of
You've been doing it from the start, breaking your own heart.

You're breaking your own heart.
It's not too late, I'm still right here.
If only you let go of your fears.
You're breaking your heart
Taking your own heart down the lonely road
You say it's just one love
But when it's close enough you just let it go
The very thing you've been the most afraid of
You've been doing it from the start, breaking your own heart.

"You sit there in your heartache
Waitin' on some beautiful boy to
To save you from your old ways
You play forgiveness, watch it now, here he comes

He doesn't look a thing like Jesus
But he, talks like a gentleman
Like you imagined when you were young

Can we climb this mountain? I don't know
Higher now than ever before
I know we can make it if we take it slow
Let's take it easy, easy now, watch it go

We're burnin' down the highway skyline
On the back of a hurricane, that started turnin'
When you were young
When you were young

And sometimes you close your eyes
And see the place where you used to live
When you were young

They say the Devil's water, it ain't so sweet
You don't have to drink right now
But you can dip your feet
Every once in a little while

Woo!

You sit there in your heartache
Waitin' on some beautiful boy to
To save you from your old ways
You play forgiveness, watch it now, here he come

where the sun has never shone

and the world is like an apple
whirling silently in space

keys that jungle in your rocket,
words that jangle in your head.
why did summer go so quickly?
was it something that you said?
lovers walk along the shore,
and leave their foot prints in the sand.
is the sound of distant drumming,
just the fingers of your hand?
pictures hanging in a hallway,
and the fragment of a song
half remembered names and faces,
but to whom do they belong?
when you knew that is was over,
you were suddenly aware
that the autumn leaves were turning
to the colour of his hair.
round like a circle in a spiral
like a wheel within a wheel
never ending or beginning
on an ever spinning reel
as the images unwind,
like the circles that you find，
in the windmills of your mind.

"I haven't really ever found a place that I call home
I never stick around quite long enough to make it
I apologize that once again I'm not in love
But it's not as if I mind
that your heart ain't exactly breaking
It's just a thought, only a thought
But if my life is for rent and I don't learn to buy
Well I deserve nothing more than I get
Cos nothing I have is truly mine
I've always thought
that I would love to live by the sea
To travel the world alone
and live my life more simply
I have no idea what's happened to that dream
Cos there's really nothing left here to stop me
It's just a thought, only a thought
But if my life is for rent and I don't learn to buy
Well I deserve nothing more than I get
Cos nothing I have is truly mine
But if my life is for rent and I don't learn to buy
Well I deserve nothing more than I get
Cos nothing I have is truly mine
While my heart is a shield and I won't let it down
While I am so afraid to fail so I won't even try
Well how can I say I'm alive
If my life is for rent and I don't learn to buy
Well I deserve nothing more than I get
Cos nothing I have is truly mine

"How could you 
You are the river 
Pour out of this life 

How could you 
You are the morning bird 
Who sang me into life every day 
Fly away 

You are the blood of me 
The harvest of my dreams 
There's nowhere I can find peace 
And the silence won't cease 

Nothing's quite how it seems 
The ghost of my joy 
Won't let me be 

If you set me free I will not run 
I will not run 
I will not run",2

And even the dry dreams got wet
My eyes got raining..
My sleep cries in the corners of eyelashes
My eyes got raining..
My tears fall and heart gets hurt
My eyes got raining..
It's like weather of separation's clouds
 
Black black blank nights, are becoming my friend..
Lost, lost in these paths, I have nothing of my own..
Every moment every Second, how I bear..
Every moment every Second, to myself, I keep saying..
I've forgotten you..
Then why do your memories..
make me cry..
 
I hear the words written in your memories..
Passed moments ask why we got separated like this.. God..
God, this distance I've got...
God, it's your decision...
God, it was supposed to be and it happened....That you had written
 
For two moments I was attached to you
Then the path was turned such..
I started getting lost from you
Like something was getting away..
that was mine
You only pray for me now
You only part me from this pain
Being yours, I am not anymore yours
I say this to myself
 
I've forgotten you
Then why do your memories
make me cry
 
Since you aren't here, these lips are only complaining
When you were gonna separate us then why did you got us close..

God your love will get separated too
God then you will know pain of this distance (separation)",2

Bury your head

I was feeling fine
You'll be coming clean tonight
And I'll be falling down with you once again
Call me your valentine, call me once tonight

The things you said, I'm rehearsing them

They went back on us

I could know him to come on to it

Bury your head
Has the child smashed you down
And the psalms will never call me again

Sold right and all
They wandered around and round my mouth,
They stole my life
Sold right and all
(Stole it all)
They have been the ones who've seen enough

They went back on us

"Aight, man, whatever...

Spoken:
Dre, just let it run.
Hey yo, turn the beat up a little bit
Hey yo, this song is for anyone... fuck it, just shut up and listen
Hey yo

I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zags and this bag
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this... on this earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse

And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensin' these sentences gettin' this stress
That's been eatin' me recently off of this chest

And I rest again peacefully (peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter

To not come and speak to me (speak to me)
I don't know you and no, I don't owe you a mo-therfuck-ing thing
I'm not Mr. *NSYNC, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick

If you tempt me my tank is on empty (is on empty)
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you 10 feet (10 feet) in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me destroy you

Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of arguin' (of arguin)
I don't mean to be mean, but that's all I can be, it's just me

And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content.
That song ""Guilty Conscience"" has gotten such rotten responses.""

And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinky

Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school

And they blame it on Marilyn (on Marilyn) and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see an upper class city

Havin' this happenin' (this happenin' )
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way (rap this way)
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
To burn and it's burnin' and I have returned

And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on ""My Name Is""

And pigeonholed into some poppy sensation
That copped me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (got the patience)
To deal with these cocky caucasians

Who think, I'm some wigger who just tries to be black
'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
So they always keep askin' the same fuckin' questions (fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in?

The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
Till I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out (ahhh)
'Cause they drivin' me crazy (me crazy)
I can't take it, I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit

And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without someone standin' by it
No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am

I don't know, it's just the way I am",3
"How dare you say that my behavior's unacceptable?
So condescending, unnecessarily critical

You want to stay, but you know very well I want you gone
Not fit to fuckin' tread the ground that I am walkin' on

Is it painful to learn that it's me that has all the control?
Does it thrill? Does it sting?

And I fall in love every day and I feel like a fool

Apartment 108
I'll always keep you in my heart
Anderson is cold tonight,
The leaves are scattered on the ground
I miss the seasons in the comfort of your smile

Sometimes this song feels like a dream,
I'm waiting for someone just to wake me up from this life
As I look out on these fairgrounds,
I remember how our family split apart

I don't think I ever told you,
But I know you always did your best
In the hard times that only made us stronger

As I sit here all alone,
I wonder how I'm supposed to carry on
When you're gone

I'll never be the same without you,
I love you more than you will ever know
So maybe now you finally know:
Sometimes we're helpless and alone,
But you can't let it keep you weighted down
You must go on

Do you ever feel like crying?
Do you ever feel like giving up?
I raise my hands up towards the sky
And say this prayer for you tonight,
Because nothing is impossible

As I sit here all alone,
I wonder how I'm supposed to carry on
When you're gone

I'll never be the same without you,
I love you more than you will ever know
So maybe now you finally know:
Sometimes we're helpless and alone,
But you can't let it keep you weighted down
You must go on

The hardest part isn't finding what we need to be,
It's being content with who we are

Stay who you are

Stay who you are
Stay who you are

Stay who you are
Stay who you are",2

Until there's fog inside the glass around your summer heart

I can't be sure that this state of mine
Is not of my own design

For loneliness like this

Something's missing
And I don't know how to fix it

No I don't know what it is
Something's different
And I don't know what it is
No I don't know what it is

"Too young to be scared

Optimistic, tell the truth she don't care

Locks her lips, she ke-ga-go ke-ga-go
She got over my head
So wake up you dreamy boy

You're harnessing a giant
And you're painting on my wings
In red paint and my wings are feather white

Police sirens up
So you're an angel true in a movie down my street

Wake up, Danny boy, there's a world outside

A world outside, a world outside
Wake up, Danny boy, there's a world outside
A world outside your window

Wake up

You can't force change or change your path
You just have to walk on it, the woods at night
With red walls, leisurely slow, no one sees you moving but you

So long my friends

I think it's time you try again

So wake up, wake up

Wake up, Danny boy, there's a world outside
A world outside, a world outside
Wake up, Danny boy, there's a world outside
A world outside your window

A world outside, a world outside
Wake up, Danny boy, there's a world outside
A world outside your window

Your window, your window

Wake up

Wake up

Wake up, Danny boy, there's a world outside
A world outside, a world outside
Wake up, Danny boy, there's a world outside
A world outside your window

A world outside, a world outside
Wake up, Danny boy, there's a world outside
A world outside your window

"Judge not and shall be judged first
Die nigga, die nigga

Look in my eyes, see what I see
Do what I do, be what I be
Walk with my shoes that hurt your feet
And know why I lurk the streets

Burning in hell, but don't deserved to be
Got niggas I don't even know that wanna murder me
It's because they heard of me
And they know that the Dark is for real
The bark is for real, when you see that spark it'll kill
Be poppin', robbin and chill, take it over there bark wit' it
From Ohio to Cali to Baltimore back to New York wit' it
Come through flyin', a 129
Up the school street 'cause I come through mine
Barking my dogs, get at me nigga
Arf arf arf
Get at me nigga
What the deal is, never forget what real is
Them cats that used to say X is the best know he still is
Can't help but feel this, putting goosebumps on your arms
Take you there if you want but I lose chunks with the bomb
Then come for the star
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and it's getting warm
Feel me yo

Look in my eyes, see what I see
Do what I do, be what I be
Walk with my shoes that hurt your feet
And know why I lurk the streets

Look in my eyes, see what I see
Do what I do, be what I be
Walk with my shoes that hurt your feet
And know why I lurk the streets

I can understand why y'all niggas is scared of me
And why the big dogs never wanted to play fair with me
'Cause I leave blood wherever I go, wherever I flow
Wherever I blow niggas who know I can go
Feel me yo
What is it about the Dark that gets niggas where they about to spark
About to bark, take it to the heart 'cause it's real like that
Give him chills, but do I make him feel like that
Shit is real, what you don't know is gon' getcha
With the steal, what you don't know is gon' splitcha
I can blaze tracks
Make niggas play raps and raise stacks
Paybacks a bitch, didn't you used to say that
Play around in dirt, you get mugged
'Cause you know, I can either spread love or shed blood
And bloodshed turns to mudred and real sticky
Or I can hit you from roof, make it a quicky
For real

Look in my eyes, see what I see
Do what I do, be what I be
Walk with my shoes that hurt your feet
And know why I lurk the streets

I bear my soul, niggas wouldn't dare, my role
Gives a nigga a heart of gold but with a hole
Lost all control, my shoulders hold a lot of weight
Just like first time soldier eighth done told us not to hate
But then it's out of state, and it's too late
For change is to be made
That's what I get for fucking with strangers in the shade
This is it, that nigga's got to give me a place
For the same reason that fate, chose to give me away
Take away hate, now I'm supposed to love the one that cursed me
The one that wouldn't give me a cup of water when I was thirsty
It was always his versus me, but now I gotta teach him
Personal feelings put aside, 'cause now I gotta reach him
What I'd like to do is turn my head, like I don't know him
But it seems like I've been called on to show him
So I'ma show him
And if you never met me, then you've no right to judge me
I've got a good heart but this heart can get ugly

Look in my eyes, see what I see
Do what I do, be what I be
Walk with my shoes that hurt your feet
And know why I lurk the streets

Look in my eyes, see what I see
Do what I do, be what I be
Walk with my shoes that hurt your feet
And know why I lurk the streets

Feel the pain, feel the joy, of a man who was never a boy. For real.

I'm only seventeen
The many years between us
Have been broken
Look at me,under the ever green
Life is a mellow dream
Almost unspoken
By the way
You said you're here to stay
Let me love you till tomorrow
Then it will last a year and a day
Maybe we're here to forget

Look at me, I'm only seventeen
It hasn't been too long
But it's been lonely
Look at me,and smell the tangerine
Life is a mellow song

"In my hour of need
Ha you’re not there
And though I reached out for you
Wouldn’t lend a hand

Through the darkest hour
Grace did not shine on me
It feels so cold， very cold
No one cares for me

Did you ever think I get lonely
Did you ever think that I needed love
Did you ever think to stop thinking
You’re the only one that I’m thinking of
You’ll never know how hard I tried
To find my space and satisfy you too
Things will be better when I’m dead and gone
Don’t try to understand， knowing you I’m probably wrong
But oh how I lived my life for you
Still you’d turn away
Now as I die for you
My flesh still crawls as I breathe your name
All these years I thought I was wrong
Now I know it was you
Raise your head raise your face your eyes
Tell me who you think you are， who ?
I walk， I walk alone
Into the promised land
There’s a better place for me
But it’s far， far away
Everlasting life for me
In a perfect world
But I gotta die first
Please God send me on my way
Time has a way of taking time
Loneliness is not only felt by fools
Alone I call to ease the pain
Yearning to be held by you， alone， so alone， I’m lost
Consumed by the pain
The pain， the pain， the pain
Won’t you hold me again
You just laughed， ha， ha， bitch
My whole life is work built on the past
But the time has come when all things shall pass
This good thing passed away

"Oh no, what have I done

Never mean to use that gun

Cam home early, found them in my bed

I went half crazy and I shot them dead

I hit it sound down to Mexico

Base to rely without Peru

But I got caught down in Birmingham

Just sad son, you're going down
Bury you in the cold cold ground

No one here can understand

What goes through the heart of a jealous man

When I face all my judgement day

I hope the law don't turn away

I pay with my life for what I've done

Leave it in the hand of my father son

Tomorrow morning I'm going down

Bury me in the cold cold ground

"If you ever make it back to Nashville
Remember you have still got a friend
I'll meet you at the Parthenon
That's the place we always went

It's been so dull since you left Nashville
I've read the same books again &amp; again
It makes me wish I wasn't bashful
When it comes to other men

But if I could have my way
Darling you'd come home

Remember when you moved to Nashville
And the first time that we kissed
Remember when your mother found us
Remember that you're sorely missed

And when you make it back to Nashville
We'll forget all of your sins
And I still buy two pairs of everything
So when you come home you &amp; I'll be twins

Because if I could have my way
I wouldn't be alone",1

Give me affection
I need your perfection
You feel so good
You make me stutter, stutter
If I could touch you, I'd never let go
Now ya got me screaming and I cannot shut up, shut up
Now I am lying on the bedroom floor barely even speaking
and I cannot get up, get up
Ohh I really, I really, I really need to know

"And there are those who hadn't found the speaking so wrong
Is it wrong?
Of Pavlov lore they ran rampant through the floors
Is this wrong? Feels so wrong
Happened on a respirator in the basement
Are they gone? Are they gone?

Stung the slang of a gallows bird
Rationed a dead letter pure
Oh, oh

Track marked amoeba lands craft
Cartwheel of scratches
Dress the tapeworm as pets
Tentacles smirk please
Flinched the cocooned meat
Infra-recon forgets

Now there are those who find comfort in the breathing wrong
Is it wrong?
It houses the watchful eyes, panting in a pattern in droves
Are they gone?
Happened on a respirator in the basement
Is it gone? Are they gone?

Stung the slang of a gallows bird
Sanctioned a dead letter pure

Track marked amoeba lands craft
Cartwheel of scratches
Dress the tapeworm as pets
Tentacles smirk please
Flinched the cocooned meat

Evaporated the fur because it covers them
If you only knew the plans they had for us
Evaporated the fur because it covers them
If you only knew the plans they had for us

They used to have pulses in them
But impulses made them strong
They used to have pulses in them
But impulses made them strong

Evaporated the fur because it covers them
If you only knew the plans they had for us

"I see it in your eyes
Your feeling paranoid
You know just what I've done
You know what I've become
I feel it deep inside
With all the pain and lies
I know just what I want
I am an animal

I think it's time I let you go
(Why did you send me off ?)

You can't cage the beast !
There's no break in me
You can't cage the beast inside of me
I feel the rage
And all the the pain
You can't cage the beast inside of me
Inside of me

I feel it in your vine
You are a parasite
Who knows just what I've done
I think your time has come
You tried to turn the tide
I think you've lost your mind
Afraid of what I want
This sick animal I've become

I think it's time I let you go
(Why did you send me off ?)

You can't cage the beast !
There's no break in me
You can't cage the beast inside of me
I feel the rage
And all the pain
You can't cage the beast inside of me
Inside of ME !

"i admit i was blue
but she is forgotten
she has to learn something
to be the one to blame
she is forgiven
she is far too sweet for a boy like me
chorus
do you look out
for me
and wonder where i might be
are you happy alone
or have you found a boy so soon
i see my friends
almost everyday
never a glimpse of Kay
i go shopping
when i'm alone
just to pick me up
i can be happy
i don't need someone to tell me my mistakes
she can't be happy
i can't imagine
her without me

do you look out
for me
and wonder where i might be
are you happy alone

"There's a party going on in here for real
I got more product than Ron Popeil
So deal with that troop, we're troopers
The only air time you get is on Bloopers

Beatsie Boys in the place, up in the space
So renovate or evacuate
You better think twice before you start flossing
I been in your bathroom often

Taking punk MC's out, I'm all about
My to do list today is turn the party out
Getting hot in here no room to breathe
I got my pen in my hand so you best not sleep

No I'm not Herman Munster nor Dr. Spock
I go by the name of the King Ad-Rock
So here's a match my ass and your face
Listen when I tell you dog
I'm in your crawlspace

You're in front of my house and you know that's whack
Bite my rhymes with a scanner from Radio Shack
You suckers try to front like you've got the force
But I'll slay you like Vader sip you for a first course

Don't even get me started on the intercourse...
AHHHHH!!
Don't step into my zone or even periphery
Can't grab a hold of my style it's too slippery

The way you act a fool son you can't erase
And you're running on your way like a steeple chase
You tried to take my title put it back in place
But now you're busted wearing panties and lace

Stealing my style from my trophy case
But my drive's secure like on an army base
You're sneaking and peeking and trying to give chase
You ain't never gonna catch me;
I'm in your crawl space

Schematics, blueprints and microfilm
Calibrate your sonar when I'm in your realm
'Cause you know we're getting scarier and scarier
And this extends beyond the Tri-State area

Omnipresent and omnipotent
My rhymes are whales and yours are rodents
This means huge compared to very small
You look a little chilly, can I get you a shawl?

'Cause these rhymes are 200 proof
They're like anvils lined up on a roof
Waiting to drop on your corny melon
'Cause were not buying what you're selling

First you want to battle then you start to whine
You're looking hungry, it must be snack time
So run home where you feel safe
But don't sleep Cochise;
I'm in your crawlspace",1
"Now the rain comes down the windows and it,
Drops onto the forehead of the waiting boy,
He surveys his rental kingdom and he,
Wonders if he's really lost his one joy.

Another fool would go down to the,
Only place she ever went to lose herself,
She's gone to the movies now and she,
Don't need your help.

Now the rain turns into snowfall as the,
City sky reflects the silver street below,
And it covers up the cars,
And the Wall-flowers CD ended half an hour ago.

Another fool would dig the broken car out from the snow,
And drive to find the show,
She's gone to the movies now and she's,
Not coming home,
She's gone to the movies now and she's,
Not coming home.

Now he looks around his place and anyways,
There's nowhere she could sit besides the bed,
And he wonders if the car will start tomorrow,
Or he'll have to take the bus instead.

Any other fool would be out on the roadway,
Trying to spot her rusted Pontiac,
She's gone to the movies now and she's,
Not coming back,
She's gone to the movies now and she's,
Not coming back.",4
"I need you now
I'm fine don't believe it
You know me enough to know that's a lie
I'm close hard as it is to say
To total this as I barely holding on

I need you now I need you now don't turn away
I need you now oh please don't turn me away
I need you now I need you now

Out here where I've been spinning
It's nearly impossible to slow down
One night of your company
Might be the only thing to keep me sane

The clock is ticking and the fuse is burning
Can't keep runnin' from what is coming
Don't turn me away don't turn me away

I need you now I need you now don't turn away
I need you now oh please don't turn me away

How many times have I come to you vulnerable like this?
I know you have the right to question but please don't ask
I need you now
The clock is ticking and the fuse is burning
Don't turn me away Can't keep runnin' from what is coming
I need you now
I need you now I need you now
Don't turn away I need you now oh please don't turn me away

I need you now The clock is ticking and the fuse is burning
I need you now oh please don't turn me away
I need you now I need you now

The clock is ticking and the fuse is burning

The clock is ticking and the fuse is burning
Can't keep runnin' from what is coming

Let it go

Can't hold you back anymore

Let it go

Turn my back and slam the door

The snow blows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen

A kingdom of isolation and it looks like I'm the Queen

The wind is howling like the swirling storm inside

Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried

Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl
You always had to be
Conceal, don't feel
Don't let them know

Well, now they know

It's funny how some distance

Makes everything seem small

And the fears that once controlled me
Can't get to me at all

Up here in the cold thin air
I finally can breathe

I know i left a life behind but I'm to relieved to grieve
.
Let it go
Let it go

Can't hold you back anymore

Let it go
Let it go
Turn my back and slam the door

And here I stand

And here I'll stay

The cold never bothered me anyway

Standing frozen in the life I've chosen

You won't find me, the past is so behind me

Buried in the snow

Can't hold you back anymore

Let it go

Turn my back and slam the door

"Let's begin now
three six
I woke up this morning
and I said
you know instead of
waitin' for a good day to have
you know waitin' around
through up's and down's
I just say look

We're gonna have we're gonna have a good day
and all my homies gonna ride today
and all these mommies look fly today
and all we wanna do is get by today
heyyy, we're gonna have a good day
and ain't nobody gotta cry today
cause ain't nobody gonna die today
you save that trouble for another day
heyyy, we're gonna have a good day

Hair line fresh
new cologne on
feelin' so good
changed the color to my phone
orange cool-aid go good with patron
(oh no hell no boy)
is still my ring tone free car wash
had to clean up my dodge
give back when I can just playin' my part
church folk had a fish fry
mustard, hot sauce, light bread, french fries
look for the big guy
hit the park
boys showin' off their hops
Nappy Roots on the radio
and you know it bops
last night it hit the big three
bought some Air Force ones
4 tall tees man I love the BG

We're gonna we're gonna have a good day
and all my homies gonna ride today
and all these mommies look fly today
and all we wanna do is get by today
heyyy, we're gonna have a good day
and ain't nobody gotta cry today
cause ain't nobody gonna die today
you save that trouble for another day
heyyy, we're gonna have a good day

We're gonna have a good day
and I ain't worry bout what nobody say
I'm still above ground that's the reason I pray
got my car cleaned up now I'm ready to play
make call to the sticks say I'm headin' that way
heard my cousin cookin out I gotta give  me a plate
got this new outfit ain't even out in the states
so if they ain't speakin' to soon it's a hell of a day
and this stinky got me sitin' in a hell of a place
got my stunna shades on a grin on my face
new grill looks mean but I swear I'm straight
and the hood showin' love so I'm okay

We're gonna we're gonna have a good day
and all my homies gonna ride today
and all these mommies look fly today
and all we wanna do is get by today
heyyy, we're gonna have a good day
and ain't nobody gotta cry today
cause ain't nobody gonna die today
you save that trouble for another day
heyyy, we're gonna have a good day

We might as well do exactly what the children sayin'
take the day off
hit park and just hang
barbque roll a few and put up your dukes
if it's beef put the peace down and put up your dukes
it's time to change our ways
so we can save the day for the children sake
and make a better place to play
if it's all good you got your group and grip your wood
and if you ridin' dirty just light the flip and blow yor sss...
but do it real big exactly like a player should
enjoy your 24's
do your thing and rep your hood
the world is all yours
but still we all grind
forever and a day
the choice you make is relly all fine

We're gonna we're gonna have a good day
and all my homies gonna ride today
and all these mommies look fly today
and all we wanna do is get by today
heyyy, we're gonna have a good day
and ain't nobody gotta cry today
cause ain't nobody gonna die today
you save that trouble for another day
heyyy we're gonna have a good day
and all my homies gonna ride today
and all these mommies look fly today
and all we wanna do is get by today
heyyy we're gonna have a good day
and ain't nobody gotta cry today
cause ain't nobody gonna die today
you save that trouble for another day

I can hardly breathe
I need to feel you here with me
Yeah

When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missing you
When you're gone
The face I came to know
is missing too
When you're gone
The words I need to hear
to always get me through the day
And make it OK
I miss you

"I found God
On the corner of First and Amistad
Where the west
Was all but won
All alone
Smoking his last cigarette
I said, ""Where you been?""
He said, ""Ask anything""

Where were you
When everything was falling apart?
All my days
Were spent by the telephone
That never rang
And all I needed was a call
That never came
From the corner of First and Amistad

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

But in the end
Everyone ends up alone
Losing her
The only one who's ever known
Who I am
Who I'm not, and who I wanna be
No way to know
How long she will be next to me

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you, where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

The early morning
The city breaks
And I've been calling
For years and years and years and years
And you never left me no messages
You never sent me no letters
You got some kind of nerve
Taking all I want

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Where were you, where were you?

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?

To find me, to find me?",2
"Sunrise sunrise
Looks like morning in your eyes
But the clocks had nine fifteen for hours

Sunrise sunrise
Couldn't tempt us if it tried
Cause the afternoon's already come and gone
And I said
hooohooo hooohooo hooohooo
Do you

Surprise surprise
Couldn't find it in your eyes
But I'm sure it's written all over my face

Surprise surprise
Never something I could hide
When I see we've made through another day
Then I say
hooohoo hooohooo hooohooo
Do you

Now the night
throw its cover down
mmm on me again
Ooo and if I'm right
It's the only way to bring me back
Hooohooo hooohooo hooohooo
Do you
Hooohooo hooohooo hooohooo

"It started with a low light
Next thing I knew they ripped me from my bed
And then they took my blood type
They left a strange impression in my head

You know that I was hoping
That I could leave this star-crossed world behind
But when they cut me open
I guess I changed my mind

And you know I might have just flown
Too far from the floor this time
'Cause they're calling me by my name

And they're zipping white light beams
Disregarding bombs and satellites
And that was the turning point
That was one lonely night

The dream maker's gonna make you mad
The spaceman says, ""Everybody look down
It's all in your mind""

Well, now I'm back at home and
I'm looking forward to this life I live
You know it's gonna haunt me
Some hesitation to this life I give

You think you might cross over
You're caught between the devil and the deep blue sea
You better look it over
Before you make that leap

And you know I'm fine
But I hear those voices at night
Sometimes they justify my claim

And the public don't dwell on my transmission
'Cause it wasn't televised
But it was a turning point
Oh, what a lonely night

The storm maker says it ain't so bad
The dream maker's gonna make you mad

It's all in your mind""

So holy light shines on the things you have done
Ho I asked him how he became this man
How that he learned to hold fruit in his hands

And where is the lamb that gave you your name?
He had to leave though I begged him to stay
Left me alone when you needed the light
Fell to me knees and you wept for your life

If he had of stayed, you might understand
If he had of stayed, you never would've taken my hand

He wrote, I'm alone
Please, send for me
But I'm broken too and spoken for
Do not tempt me

And where is the lamb that gave you your name?
He had to flee though I begged him to stay
Begged him to stay in my cold wooden grip
Begged him to stay by the light of my ship

Me fighting him, fighting light, fighting dawn
The waves came and stole him and took him toward

He wrote, I'm broke
Please, send for me
But I'm broken too and spoken for
Do not tempt me

Forgive me, Hera, I cannot stay

"Ira Hayes  Ira Hayes Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

Gather round me people there's a story I would tell

About a brave young Indian you should remember well
From the tribe of the Pima Indian
A proud and peaceful band
Who farmed the Phoenix valley in Arizona land
Down the ditches for a thousand years
The water grew Ira's peoples' crops
'Till the white man stole the water rights
And the sparklin' water stopped
Now Ira's folks were hungry
And their land grew crops of weeds
When war came, Ira volunteered
And forgot the white man's greed
Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

There they battled up Iwo Jima's hill,
Two hundred and fifty men
But only twenty-seven lived to fight back down again
And when the fight was over
And when Old Glory raised
Among the men who held it high
Was the Indian, Ira Hayes

Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

Ira returned a hero
Celebrated through the land
He was wined and speeched and honored;
Everybody shook his hand
But he was just a Pima Indian
No water, no crops, no chance
At home nobody cared what Ira'd done
And when did the Indians dance

Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

Then Ira started drinkin' hard;

Jail was often his home
They'd let him raise the flag and lower it
like you'd throw a dog a bone!

He died drunk early one mornin'
Alone in the land he fought to save
Two inches of water in a lonely ditch
Was a grave for Ira Hayes

Call him drunken Ira Hayes
He won't answer anymore
Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian
Nor the Marine that went to war

Yeah, call him drunken Ira Hayes

But his land is just as dry
And his ghost is lyin' thirsty
In the ditch where Ira died

Another moment trapped in time

Like soldiers from a long lost war
We share the scars from our abandoned
And what we remember becomes folklore

You run around unaware
Of how delicate each beat
Trembles in here...",4
"She can’t see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile
She’ll never notice how you stop and stare whenever she walks by
And you can’t see me wantin' you the way you want her
But you are everything to me

I just wanna show you
She don’t even know you
She's never gonna love you like I want to
And you just see right through me
If you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Miracle
Unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

There’s a fire inside of you
That can’t help but shine through
She’s never gonna see the light no matter what you do
And all I think about is how to make you think of me
And everything that we could be

I just wanna show you
She don’t even know you
Baby, let me love you
Let me want you
You just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Miracle
Unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

Like shadows in a faded light
Oh, we’re invisible
I just wanna open your eyes
And make you realize

I just wanna show you
She don’t even know you
Baby, let me love you
Let me want you
You just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Miracle
Unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

She can’t see the way your eyes light up when you smile

"I feel it's changing, I stay the same
I'm...a solo cello outside a chor-us
I've got a secret
It's time for me to tell that you've been keeping me warm

Just sweet beginnings and bitter en-dings
In coffee city, we borrowed hea-ven
Don't give it back
I've never felt so wanted, Are you taking me home?

You tell me you have to go...
In the heat of summer sunshine
I miss you like nobody else
In the heat of summer sunshine
I kiss you, and nobody needs to know

Now that you've left me, there's no retur-ning
I keep comparing, you're always win-ning
I try to be strong but you'll never be more wanted
Will you make me at home?
Don't tell me you have to go...
In the heat of summer sunshine
I miss you like nobody else
In the heat of summer sunshine
I kiss you, and nobody needs to know

To sweet beginnings and bitter en-dings
In coffee city, we borrowed hea-ven
Don't give it back
Winter is coming and I need to stay warm

The heat...
In the heat of summer sunshine
I miss you like nobody else
In the heat of summer sunshine
I kiss you, and nobody knows
In the heat of summer sunshine
I miss you like nobody else
In the heat of summer sunshine
I kiss you, and nobody needs to know

"Hey lady, you, lady, cursing at your life
You're a discontented mother
and a regimented wife
I've no doubt you dream about
the things you'll never do
But I wish someone had talked to me
like I wanna talk to you

I've been to Georgia and California,
anywhere I could run
Took the hand of a preachman
and we made love in the sun
But I ran out of places and friendly faces
Because I had to be free
I've been to paradise,
but I've never been to me

Please lady, please, lady,
don't just walk away
Cause I have this need to tell you
why I'm all alone today
I can see so much of me
still living in your eyes
Won't you share a part of a weary heart
that has lived a million lies
Oh I've been to Nice and the isle of Greece
While I sipped champagne on a yacht
I moved like Harlow in Monte Carlo
and showed 'em what I've got
I've been undressed by kings
And I've seen some things
that a woman ain't supposed to see
I've been to paradise
But I've never been to me

(spoken) Hey, you know what paradise is? It's a lie
A fantasy we create about people
and places as we'd like them to be
But you know what truth is?
It's that little baby you're holding,
And it's that man
you fought with this morning,
the same one you're going to make
love with tonight
That's truth, that's love
Sometimes I've been to crying
for unborn children
that might have made me complete
But I, I took the sweet life
And never knew I'd be bitter from the sweet
I spent my life exploring the subtle whoring
that cost too much to be free
Hey lady, I've been to paradise
But I've never been to me
I've been to paradise
I've never been to me

I've been to paradise
I've never been to me

"Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
A young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away
Chorus
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature, wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
You Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo te amo
I prayed taht the days would last
They went so fast

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature, wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
You Spanish lullaby

I want to be where the sun warms the sky
When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
Where a girl loves a boy
And a boy loves a girl

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze
All of nature, wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
You Spanish lullaby
Tropical the island breeze
All of nature, wild and free
This is where I long to be
La isla bonita
And when the samba played
The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
You Spanish lullaby

"Hey, hey, hey, hey

You were so blind to let me go
You had it all but did not know
No one you'll find will ever be
Closer to all your dreams than me

Believing the grass would be greener
You told yourself, ""I just don't need her now.""
But I know you'll soon discover
You're never satisfied with any other

Someday, ooh someday
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday, hey, hey
Boy you're gonna pay, 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score

You'll change your mind and call my name
Soon as you find they're all the same
And when you find yourself alone
Don't come back crying, you should have known

Believe me, I'm not pretending
It's not hard to predict this ending now
'Cause I know you'll soon discover
You're needing me in spite of all the others

Someday, ooh someday
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday, hey, hey

Maybe now you just can't conceive
That there'll ever come a time when you're cold and lonely
Baby, how could you ever believe
That another could replace me, the one and only

But when you're down in your time of need
And you're thinking that you
Might be coming back to own me
Just think again 'cause
I won't need your love anymore

Someday, ooh someday
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday, hey, hey

Anywhere is where she's from
Anything is what she'll be
Anything as long as it's mine

And the door it opened a way back in
Or is it way back out?

Any place is where she'll be
Any place she'll see you from

Anytime, anywhere, she takes me away

And death climbs up the steps one by one
To give you the rose that's been burned by her son

Point me to the sky above
I can't get there on my own
Walk me to the graveyard
Dig up her bones

I have seen the demon's face
I have heard of her death place
I fall down on my knees
In praise of the...
Horrible things that take her away

And death climbs up the steps one by one
To give you the rose that's been burned by her son

"In 1814 we took a little trip
Along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississip'
We took a little bacon and we took a little beans
And we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans

We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they began to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

We looked down the river and we seed the British come
And there must have been a hundred of 'em beatin' on the drum
They stepped so high and they made their bugles ring
We stood beside our cotton bales and didn't say a thing

We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they began to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

Old Hickory said we could take 'em by surprise
If we didn't fire our muskets till we looked 'em in the eye
We held our fire till we seed their faces well
Then we opened up our squirrel guns and really gave 'em
Well we

Fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they began to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

Yeah they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles
And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go
They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

We fired our cannon till the barrel melted down
So we grabbed an alligator and we fought another round
We filled his head with cannonballs and powered his behind
And when we touched the powder off the gator lost his mind

We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin'
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago
We fired once more and they began to runnin'
On down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico

And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go
They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em

Police think they can see me lean
I'm tint so it ain't easy to be seen
When you see me ride by they can see the glean
And my shine on the deck and the TV screen
Ride with a new chick, she like hold up
Next to the playstation controller is a full clip and my pistola
Turn a jacker into a coma
Girl you ain't know, I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone
Just tryin to bone ain't tryin to have no babies
Rock clean itself so I pull in ladies
Laws of patrolling you know they hate me
Music turned all the way up until the maximum
I can speak for some niggas tryin to jack for some
But we packing something that we have and um will have a nigga locked up in the maximum
Security cell, I'm gripping oak
Music loud and tipping slow
Twist and twisting like hit this dough
Pull up from behind and is in his throat
Windows down gotta stop pollution
CDs change niggas like who is that producing?

Got warrants in every city except Houston but I'm still ain't losin

I been drinking and smoking holding shit cause a brother can't focus
I gotta get to home before the po po's scope this big ol Excursion swerving all up in the curve man
Nigga been sipping on that Hennessey and the gin again is in again we in the wind
Doing a hundred while I puff on the blunt
And rolling another one up, we living like we ain't giving a fuck
I got a revolver in my right hand, 40 oz on my lap freezing my balls
Roll a nigga tree, green leaves and all
Coming pretty deep, me and my do-jo
I gotta get back to backstreets
Wanted by the six pound and I got heat glock glock shots to the block we creep creep
Pop Pop hope cops don't see me, on a low key
With no regards for the law we dodge em like fuck em all
But I won't get caught up and brought up on charges for none of y'all
Keep a gun in car, and a blunt to spark, but well if you want, nigga you popping dark

Thinking they'll catch me on the wrong well keep tryin

It seems that I keep having the same dream over and over again, and this is why I'm up so late

And if he happens to walk in the house, I'm paranoid
I just jump up and turn off the TV
Except he says, ""Is that all you're gonna do all day, just sit around and watch TV?""

Not much you can do for love.

For ten whole days
Stayed off the streets at night for weeks.

I don＇t wanna be a catholic pagan

Now that you＇re here.

We fell in awe each other for love,
Survival, and everything else.

Please don＇t padlock
Your parents＇ bomb shelter,
Or fill her up with dust and ash.

A landfill mecca
For burnouts and whistlers,

Adolescent sour mash.
I＇m not saying
That I＇m unloved,
But I could really use it now.

So turn out the lights
Over and over and over,

We＇ll figure out the rest somehow.

I don＇t wanna be your rush-in bride,
Not anymore.

But I could say
Apollo would have a field day if he knew at all.

Sooo, I have to gooo...

Ohhhh, have to goooo...

"Put your arms around my neck
Just like a pathetic lace of death
Displays like a tarot deck
I am the card of the hanged man
And here I stand
With a flame on my hand
Do you understand?

If there is hope for me
She is flirting with the breeze
On a peculiar choreography
With the dead arms of some old southern tree

Silently, lips sealed against me
Silently, wanna walk with me?

And it makes you wanna know
If in all the stories the truth is really told

And it makes you wanna reborn
And like a snake crawl every warm season
Into a different form

When you can still kill me
When you can still cure me
Cure me

Put your lace around my face
Just like a fairytale
Through the blank of my closed eyes
You can foresee the rope within

And it makes you wanna know
How deep have you truly flown

And it makes you wanna ride
Through the fake suicide of someone
Already dead inside

Still you walk with me, silently

And it makes you wanna disclaim
Something you had really never learnt

And it makes you wanna stay
Forever tangled in the pale arms of some hanged man

Here I stand
To understand.
Violently
I have you with me...",2
"Let's take a little trip down where we used to go.
It's way beyond the street,
a place they call your soul.
We will sit down for a while,
and let the evening roll.
Don't worry about the time,
we will find a place to stay,
people around your scene,
familiar in some way,
a kind of like we did before we get so cold.
In the other questions ahead
will we get to do something,
who we gonna end up being,
how we gonna end up feeling,
what you gonna spend your free life on?
Free life.

Let's fall in love again,with music as our guide
we raise our hands and let go for the right
down into underland when lovers need a hide
we get this life free we don't know where they been
we don't know where they go when we are through them
Let's start like the sun, the dark side of the moon.
In the other questions ahead
will we get to do something,
who we gonna end up being,
how we gonna end up feeling,
what you gonna spend your free life on?
Free life.
Free life.
Free life.

It seems so long ago those empty afternoons,
with nowhere much to go,
nothing much to do,
but sit up in my room and let the world unfold,
In the other questions ahead will we get to do something,
who we gonna end up being,
how we gonna end up feeling,
what you gonna spend your free life on?
In the other questions ahead will we get to do something,
who we gonna end up being, how we gonna end up feeling,
what you gonna spend your free life on?
Free life.
Free life.

"Hear, hear the noise that moves so soft and slow

That's the sound of freshly fallen snow

Your love is gold, your love is gold

Seems, seems as though we'll be stuck out here for days

To bang upon these drums that we have made

You never know, you never know

My one, my only one

Lies sleeping in the sun

Gave chase and so we run

Nothing breaks your stride like what's become

Stack, stack the frozen wood next to the shed

Pile it up so high then paint it red

Confuse the dogs, confuse the dogs

And time, time we lost is resting on the stairs

The window out reveals the cooler air

And so we go, and so we go

My one, my only one

Lied twice to keep me on

Gave chase and so we sung

Everything that ends has still begun

From the inside of my mouth

And the slow migration south

And it's not to be denied

It's not to be denied
ohhhhhh

The moon got lost again last night
But now the sun has finally had its say
I guess I feel alright

But it hurts when I think
When I let it sink in
It's all over me

I'm watching you sleep, it hurts a lot

And all I know is
You've got to give me everything
Nothing less 'cause
You know I give you all of me

I give you everything that I am
I'm handin' over everything that I've got
'Cause I wanna have a really true love
Don't ever wanna have to go and give you up

Stay up till four in the morning and the tears are pouring
And I want to make it worth the fight
What have we been doing for all this time?
Baby, if we're gonna do it, come on, do it right

All I wanted was to know I'm safe
Don't wanna lose the love I've found
Remember when you said that you would change
Don't let me down
It's not fair how you are
I can't be complete, can you give me more?

And all I know is
You've got to give me everything
Nothing less 'cause
You know I give you all of me

Oh, please, you know what I need
Save all your lovin' for me
We can't escape the love
Give me everything that you have

And all I know is
You've got to give me everything
Nothing less 'cause
You know I give you all of me

and play Holi, O dear? (x2)

That where is the bride of Badri?
 
I’ll apply colour on Your dress
Tell me which colour, blue or red?
Your hair is flying in the air
Let me colour both Your cheeks
 
Hey Hey! Ra ra ra ra ra..

Shake Your waist a little (Dance a little)

We are staring at You from the windows and rooftops
With our eyes wide open

It’s the Holi (festival)
 
Baby, the girl is very naïve.
I’ve coloured the dress of the girl
She’s speaking non-stop in English
Please don’t mind, it’s Holi
 
O Lord Rama! A miracle has occurred
My gaze has tangled with Yours (Your gaze)
I’ve just reached my prime Youth and this cruelty has befallen
I’m a great deal of trouble

my eyes are closed but I'm awake
I wish the dream would never end
you'd still be next to me
I thought this would be easier
I'd do my thing and this would work
But now I'm here trying to find a song
to make this emptiness disappear






When all it is, is I miss you
As days go by nights go long
you'd think I'd find a better song
But I'm still here trying to find a way
to make this emptiness disappear
But it still won't disappear
Cause everywhere I go
you're always on my mind
But I just wish you wouldn't call me tonight
Cause when I hear your voice
it reminds me of the choice
I made to not always be by your side
And every time you cry
you keep the pain inside
You lie for me with ""everything's all right""
Now it's hard to say it's always hard to say
I miss you

I miss you
Cause everywhere I go
you're always on my mind
But I just wish you wouldn't call me tonight

I love the way you make me feel
It slows down time
Come in my bedroom and turn off the lights

You whisper softly in my ear
Makes me unwind
The way you touch me
Lets me know you're mine

Because I love the way
You scream my name

Will all come true

I'm holding back nothing
Saving it all for you

Climb the highest mountain

"Hence I will anoint
And whisper wholeheartedly
The creed of Hades and beyond
As I succumb to inevitable sin

For I cannot enslave myself
With imaginary words of salvation
The hypocrisy that surrounds my temple
Is assisted by pretenders to the throne

The winds that blow purity
Signify my chosen legacy
I was born to opposition
A contender to creation

In Sorte Diaboli
In Sorte Diaboli
In Sorte Diaboli
In Sorte Diaboli

For my sins
I will ask no forgiveness
For my sins
They are not to forgive

So never speak of me quietly
Stand by my confession
I voice your rebellion
Against the traitor of the world

I am the first creature of this kingdom
I will be the one
To out live his time
With the triumph of free will",3

I never thought we’d meet.
You kiss my lips, and then it’s done:

A sip of wine, a cigarette,
And then it’s time to go
I tidied up the kitchenette;
I tuned the old banjo.
I’m wanted at the traffic-jam.
They’re saving me a seat.
I’m what I am, and what I am,
Is back on Boogie Street.
And O my love, I still recall
The pleasures that we knew;
The rivers and the waterfall,
Wherein I bathed with you.
Bewildered by your beauty there,
I’d kneel to dry your feet.
By such instructions you prepare
A man for Boogie Street.
O Crown of Light, O Darkened One...
I never thought we’d meet.
You kiss my lips, and then it’s done:
I’m back on Boogie Street.
So come, my friends, be not afraid.
We are so lightly here.
It is in love that we are made;
In love we disappear.
Though all the maps of blood and flesh
Are posted on the door,
There’s no one who has told us yet
What Boogie Street is for.
O Crown of Light, O Darkened One,
I never thought we’d meet.
You kiss my lips, and then it’s done:

"Her green plastic watering can
For a fake Chinese rubber plant
In the fake plastic earth
That she bought from a rubber man
In a town full of rubber plans
To get rid of itself

It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out

She lives with a broken man
A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns
He used to do surgery
For girls in the eighties
But gravity always wins

And it wears him out
It wears him out
It wears him out
It wears

She looks like the real thing
She tastes like the real thing
My fake plastic love
But I can't help the feeling
I could blow through the ceiling
If I just turn and run

And it wears me out
It wears me out
It wears me out
It wears me out

And if I could be who you wanted
If I could be who you wanted

"For all that it cost him
He never did complain
The chicken-headed man
Feathering the rain

But the last bus is tired
And everybody's gone
The horses are waiting
In the middle of the lawn

Gone for the rodeo
Gone from the tundra, gal
It's after the fair
Is it bleeding out of you?

We'll toast a little bread
Oh look, you've left a hole
Where you laid on my bed""

There's year after frozen year
That's where I saved you there

When th elights have closed down
And watch your ponies run
Through the middle of town

Gone from the tundra now

And the planes up in the air

this world is, as if mute..
 
Where to find moments of joy,
Even time is like without a sign..
 
There are complaints on so many lips, there are many distances from the life.. Why do the dreams dampen in eyes, when the line leaves these hands, for no reason.
 
The wish I had sent,
that collided with the sky such that a call has come back..
 
where have the breaths turned their face,
I don't see any path..
where has the heartbeat left the heart,
and where have these bodies left (their) shadows
 
I, here, think this again and again..
a smoke of memories is walking with me.
 
The wish I had sent,
that collided with the sky such that a call has come back..",2

Too many noise
Invisible wires keeping us apart
So many choices
But they all the disappointments
And they only steal me away from you
Climb into our private bubble
Let's get into all kinds of trouble

There's no better method to communicate
So girl stop your talking
Words just get in the way
I'll be your man

So baby come over
From the end of the sofa
I'll be your man
I'll be your man

So many faces
Staring at their shoelaces
When all anyone want is to be seen
Well tonight let's be honest
We all want to be wanted
And darlin' you've got me wantin' you
Everything that I'm trying to say
Just sounds like a worn out cliche, so...

Slide over here let your hands feel the way

Words just get in the way

So baby come over
From the end of the sofa

Someone we just can't ignore
It's real love dripping from my heart,
You've got me tripping

"Neon shines through smoky eyes tonight
It’s two am
I’m drunk again it’s heavy on my mind

I could never love again so much as I love you
Where you end
Where I begin is like a river going through

Take my eyes
Take my heart cuz I need them no more
If never again they fall upon the one I so adore
Excuse me please one more drink
Could you make it strong
Cause I don’t need to think
She broke my heart my grace is gone
One more drink and I’ll move on

One drink to remember
Then another to forget
How could I ever dream
To find sweet love like you again
One drink to remember
And another to forget
Excuse me please one more drink
Could you make it strong
Cause I don’t need to think
She broke my heart my grace is gone
One more drink and I’ll move on
One more drink and I’ll be gone

You think of things impossible
Then the sun refused to shine
I woke with you
Beside me your cold hand lay in mine
Excuse me please one more drink
Could you make it strong
Cause I don’t need to think
She broke my heart my grace is gone
One more drink and I’ll go

"I just remembered that time at the market
Snuck up behind me and jumped on my shopping cart
And rolled down aisle five
You looked behind you to smile back at me
Crashed into a rack full of magazines
They asked us if we could leave

Can't remember what went wrong last September
Though I'm sure you'd remind me if you had to

Our love was comfortable and so broken in

I sleep with this new girl I'm still getting used to
My friends all approve, say ""she's gonna be good for you""
They throw me high fives
She says the Bible is all that she reads
And prefers that I not use profanity
Your mouth was so dirty

Life of the party and she swears that she's artsy
But you could distinguish Miles from Coltrane

Our love was comfortable and so broken in
She's perfect
So flawless
Or so they say, hey
Say, hey

She thinks I can't see the smile that she's faking
And poses for pictures that aren't being taken
I loved you
Grey sweatpants
No makeup
So perfect

Our love was comfortable and so broken in
She's perfect
So flawless
I'm not impressed
I want you back",2

I don't eat no meat.
No dairy, no sweets.
Only ripe vegtables, fresh fruit and whole wheat.
I'm from the old school, my household smells like soul food, bro.
Curry falafel, barbequed tofu.
No fish, or none of dem candy bars.
No ciggarettes.
Only ganja, and fresh squeezed juice from oranges.
Excerisin' daily, to stay healthy.
An I rarely drink water out the tap 'cause it's filthy.

Lentil soup - is- mental fruit
And, ginger root- is good for the youth.
Fresh vegetables with the ital stew.
Sweet yam fries with the green caleoo
Careful how you season and prepare your foods,
Cause you don't want to lose - vitamins and minerals
And that's the jewel-
Life brings.
Life is valuable, so I eat what comes from the ground- It's natural.
Let your food be your medicine. No exceteran.
Strictly herb, generates from the sun.
'Cause I got MELANIN.
Drink water. 8 glasses a day.
Cause that's what they say.

They say you are what you eat.
So I strive to eat healthy.
My goal in life is not to be rich or wealthy.
Cause true wealth, comes from good health and wise ways.
That's why we gotta start takin' better care of ourselves.

"Don’t know what to do anymore
I’ve lost the only love worth fighting for
I’ll drown in my tears
Don’t they see?
That which show you that which make you hurt like me
All the same
I don’t want mudslinging games
It’s such a shame
To let you walk away

Is there a chance?
A fragment of light at the end of the tunnel?
A reason to fight?
Is there a chance you may change your mind?
Or are we ashes and wine?
Don’t know if our fate’s already sealed
This day’s spinning surface on a wheel
I’m ill with the thought of your kiss
Coffee laced intoxicating on her lips

Cut it out
I’ve got no claim on you now
Not allowed to wear your freedom down

Is there a chance?
A fragment of light at the end of the tunnel?
A reason to fight?
Is there a chance you may chance your mind?
Or are we ashes and wine?

I’ll tear myself away
That is what you need
There is nothing left to say
But

Is there a chance?
A fragment of light at the end of the tunnel?
A reason to fight?
Is there a chance you may change your mind?
Or are we ashes and wine?
The day’s still ashes and wine
Or are we ashes?

"She's taken my time
convinced me she's fine
but when she leaves I'm not so sure.
It's always the same: she's playing her game
and when she goes I feel to blame.
Why won't she say she needs me?
I know she's not as strong as it seems.
Why don't I feel a cry for help?
Why don't I hear a cry for help?

I wandered around the streets of this town
trying to find sense in it all.
The rain on my face it covers the trace
of all the tears I've had to waste.
Why must we hide emotions
why must we never break down and cry?

All that I need is to cry for help.
Somebody please hear me cry for help.
All I can do is cry for help.
No need to feel ashamed

Why must we hide emotions?
Why can we never break down and cry?

All that I need is cry for help.
I will be there when you cry for help.
Why don't I hear a cry for help?
All that I need is cry for help.
Somebody please hear me cry for help.
All that I need is cry for help.
I will be there when you cry for help.

Swinging in your backyard,
All the things that we used to do.
We were cool back in high school
Ooh I really liked you,
Must've been your attitude.

And that's why you keep on runnin'
In and out of my mind.

Baby now I know why
I keep comin' back to you.

You're the one who saved me,
I feel like I owe you my life.
And as strange as it may seem,
I'll go if you take me,
I'm willing to sacrifice.

That's why you keep on runnin'
In and out of my mind.
As the years they all roll by,
It's not hard to know why,

For you not to leave me now.

Not to make you my wifey,
Man they was puttin' you down.
And now they see we rollin',
Me and you we strollin',
They don't wanna come around.

Say what I wanna say, say what I wanna say

Know that I want you

The sky in my mind is always blue
In my world the sun shines from you

Often I know I don't see
The waves of love that wash over me
Your love is a paradigm
For a man just looking for the next cheap rhyme
Visualizing paradise is a
Thing I don't wanna do, a thing I don't wanna do

But I know that I want you

The sky in my mind is always blue
In my world the sun shines from you

Life traces the line in space between
What's gone and what's gonna be
Time chases me, my mind races
To find the place where I wanna be

The sky in my mind is always blue
In my world the sun shines from you

Know that I want you
Know that I want you (end)",1

Out of cash and IOU＇S.
I've got desperate desires and unadmirable plans.
My tongue will taste of gin and malicious intent.
Bring you back to the bar.
Get you out of the cold.
A sober ,straight face gets you out of your clothes.
And they＇re scared that we know
all the crimes they＇ll commit.
Who they＇ll kiss before they get home.
I will lie awake.
Lie for fun and fake the way I hold you.
Let you fall for every empty word I say.
Barely conscious in the door where you stand.
Your eyes are fighting sleep while your mouth makes your demands.
You laugh at every word, trying hard to be cute.
I almost feel sorry for what I＇m gonna do.
And your hair smells of smoke.
Who will cast the first stone?
You can sin or spend the night all alone.
Brass buttons on your coat hold the cold
In the shape of a heart that they cut out of stone.
You＇re using all your looks that you＇ve thrown from the start.
If you let me have my way, I swear I＇ll tear you apart.
Cause it＇s all you can be.

You＇re a drunk and you＇re scared.
It＇s ladies night. All the girls drink for free.
I will lie awake.
And lie for fun and fake the way I hold you.
Let you fall for every empty word I say.

I will lie awake.

"A dustland fairytale beginning
Or just another white trash county kiss
'61, long brown hair and foolish eyes

He looked just like you'd want him to
Some kind of slick chrome American prince
A blue jean serenade
And Moon River what'd you do to me?
I don't believe you

Saw Cinderella in a party dress
But she was lookin' for a nightgown
I saw the devil wrappin' up his hands
He's getting ready for the showdown
I saw the minute that I turned away
I got my money on a pawn tonight

A change came in disguise
Of revelation, set his soul on fire
She says she always knew he'd come around

And the decades disappear like sinking ships
But we persevere, God gives us hope
But we still fear what we don't know
The mind is poison

Castles in the sky sit stranded, vandalized
With drawbridges closin'

Saw Cinderella in a party dress
But she was lookin' for a nightgown
I saw the devil wrappin' up his hands
He's getting ready for the showdown
I saw the ending when they turned the page
I threw my money and I ran away
Straight to the valley of a great divide

Out where the dreams all hide
Out where the wind don't blow
Out here the good girls died
And the sky won't snow

Out here the bird don't sing
Out here the field don't grow
Out here the bell don't ring
Out here the bell don't ring

Out here the good girls died

Now Cinderella don't you go to sleep
It's such a bitter form of refuge
Ah, don't you know the kingdom's under siege
And everybody needs you?

Is there still magic in the midnight sun
Or did you leave it back in '61?
In the cadence of a young man's eyes
Out where the dreams all hide",1

Even if for only one weekend

Watching DVD's
When I discovered all your dirty grotty magazines
You take me out shopping and all we'd buy is trainers
As if we ever needed anything to entertain us
the first time that you introduced me to your friends
and you could tell I was nervous, so you held my hand
when I was feeling down, you made that face you do
no one in the world that could replace you

This is Stan
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I..
got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window..
and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be grey,
put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad,
it's not so bad..
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote,
I hope you have a chance I ain't mad
I just think it's FUCKED UP you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
you didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you,
four hours and you just said, ""No."" That's pretty shitty man
you're like his fuckin idol He wants to be just like you man,
he likes you more than I do I ain't that mad though,
I just don't like bein lied to Remember when we met in Denver
you said if I'd write you, you would write back
see I'm just like you in a way I never knew my father neither
he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs so when I have a shitty day,
I drift away and put 'em on
cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin up
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan
P.S. We should be together too
My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I..
got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window..
and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be grey,

Dear Mister-I'm-Too-Good-To-Call-Or-Write-My-Fans,
this'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word - I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters;
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night""
about that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning
but didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late - I'm on a 1000 downers now, I'm drowsy
and all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped +ALL+ of your pictures off the wall
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you SCREAM about it
I hope your conscience EATS AT YOU and you can't BREATHE without me See Slim
Shut up bitch! I'm tryin to talk!
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin in the trunk
but I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up,
see I ain't like you cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how'm I supposed to send this shit out?

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I..
got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window..
and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be grey,
put your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad,
it's not so bad..
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
and here's an autograph for your brother,
I wrote it on the Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin dogg,
c'mon - how fucked up is you?
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling
to help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time before you hurt yourself,
I think that you'll be doin just fine if you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan
why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
and had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
and in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about, his name was.. it was you
Damn!

It's not about what you're driving you know

"If I should shed a tear
It's just the love I'm showing, you're leaving here
If I should shed my pride

And where you go, my love will be there with you
No matter where you are or if you find someone new
Long ago, I reeled my life to you
And I can change my heart even though we'll be apart

Don't let my teardrops bother you
The reason I'm crying I can't believe we're through
Don't let my teardrops bother you
If you must leave me do what you gotta do

If I should beg and plead
It's just because of love and the need I have for you
If I should stall for time
It's just because I'm praying you'll change your mind
And maybe find, there's something you're leaving behind

Maybe you'll see where you've been blind
But if someone has managed to erase me
And she's-a what you want, if she's what you want
She's what you want to replace me

Don't let my teardrops bother you
The reasons I'm crying I can't believe we're through
Don't let it, don't let my teardrops bother you
If you must leave me, do what you gotta do

Don't let my teardrops bother you

Can you make it feel like home, if I tell you you're mine

Try to have fun in the meantime

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
Choose your last words
This is the last time
Cause you and I, we were born to die

Lost but now I am found
I can see but once I was blind
I was so confused as a little child
Tried to take what I could get
Scared that I couldn't find
All the answers, honey

Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laugh,

"Walking alone 'cause the night is dead.
Crossed my mind when I crossed the bridge.

when I would call you up so we could shoot the moon.

I found a verse and a chorus
so I might have been faking it.
Think I might have only cried just once.

After all the shows,
after the boys of summer had gone
amid all the confusion
and friends I've been losing
I always thought from the start
I'd be the one moving on.
I guess I'll never know
Where all the boys of summer will go
but I'll miss what me made
and the days were not wasted.
There are some things I may never know.

How you lost your mind,

and you wanted better love
well it's sleeping in your bedroom.

I think about you, baby
And I dream about you all the time

I'm here without you, baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight it's only you and me

As the people leave and wave to say hello
I've heard this life is overrated
But I hope that it gets better as we go

Under wear all the imminent disaster
Open up your eyes.
As you ruminate the hopeless ends of time.
Did you wander out your days lost and resigned?
Or recreate the universes in your mind?
Everybody is a bastard
The world is, like plaster.
And the momentary pleasures take their turn,
As the wistful boy runs out of things to learn.
The episodes of your are never to return.
Scare up some hope,
You’re gonna need it just to cope,
You are the decision, numbers don’t rely.
When you bite the dust,
Wasn’t the purpose all for trust,
You’ll never relive it,
Think before you die.

In the wake of desperation.

Sunny sat down in the kitchen
She opened a book and a box of tools
Sunny came home with a mission

She says ""Days go by, I'm hypnotized
I'm walking on a wire
I close my eyes and fly out of my mind
Into the fire""

Sunny came home with a list of names
She didn't believe in transcendence
And it's time for a few small repairs, she said
Sunny came home with a vengeance

She says ""Days go by, I don't know why 
I'm walking on a wire
I close my eyes and fly out of my mind

Dry is good and wind is better
Count the years, you always knew it
Strike a match, go on and do it

Will a lady pin me in her hair? 
Will a child find me by a stream?

It blooms to spread love and joy faith and hope to people forlorn

Inside every man lives the seed of a flower
If he looks within he finds beauty and power

Ring all the bells sing and tell the people that be everywhere that the flower has come
Light up the sky with your prayers of gladness and rejoice for the darkness is gone
Throw off your fears let your heart beat freely at the sign that a new time is born",1

Name this for me, heat the cold air
Take the chill off of my life
And if i could i'd turn my eyes
To look inside to see what's comin'

I'm frantic in your soothing arms
I can not sleep in this down filled world
I've found safety in this loneliness
But i can not stand it anymore
Cross my heart hope not to die
Swallow evil, ride the sky
Lose myself in a crowded room
You fool, you fool, it will be here soon

I cannot sleep with a head like this
I wanna cry, I wanna scream

My heart keeps asking me this every moment
Why am I so faithful to You?1
Why my desire for You is greater than any other wish of mine?
Why do my lips utter only Your name?
Why do I have deep yearning/passion to become Your partner
I want to drink every single teardrop of Yours and give away all my comfort(for You)
I desire You every single day, I gaze upon Your path all the time
I want to keep You safe in my arms
 
I talk only about You now
You’ve had such an effect upon me
I don’t need any advice or instruction (from anyone)
My soul has selected You
Why do I have deep yearning to become Your partner?
I want to drink every single teardrop of Yours and give away all my comfort
I desire You every single day, I gaze upon Your path all the time
I want to keep You safe in my arms
 
My heart is worried without any reason
May someone come and calm it
To sacrifice oneself in it, is a custom of love
If there’s a quality of patience in it, then it isn’t true love
O my heart! Please make me understand this mystery
Why do I have deep yearning to become Your partner?
I want to drink every single teardrop of Yours and give away all my comfort
I desire You every single day, I gaze upon Your path all the time
I want to keep You safe in my arms

If I was you I would too damn right
If I had drama with a nigga like such as myself
I couldn't even sleep at night until...

Pull out guns exchange a fight
Be the first to let off mines ignite the pipes...
And never let the daylight deceive
During the suns' hours niggaz do bleed
Aim for the waist and something on the top gets shot
Niggaz can't shoot never made a thing drop
Keep cream of the crop

Tried to show me once how to tango
Round and round your feet

Round and round like good little roses

Blood roses, blood roses
Back on the street now

Blood roses, blood roses
Back on the street now, now, now

Now you've cut out the flute
From the throat of the loon
At least when you cry now
He can't even hear you

When chickens get a taste of your meat, girl

Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Oh when he sucks you deep, yes

Sometimes you're nothing but meat

"Who the fuck
Do you think you are
Get out
Of my hair
who the fuck
do you think you are
Comin\' round

Who the fuck?
Who the fuck?

Do you think you are
Get your comb
Out of there
Coming out
My hair
I\'m not like other girls
You can\'t straighten my curls
I\'m not like other girls
You can\'t straighten my curls
Who the fuck
You tryin\' to be?
Get your dog
Away from me!
What the fuck
You doing in there
Get your dirty fingers
Outta my hair!

"Scotch and Soda
Mud in yer eye
Baby do I feel high oh me oh my
Do I feel high

Dry martini
Jigger of gin
Oh what a spell you've got me in, oh my
Do I feel high

People won't believe me
They'll think that I'm just braggin'
But I could feel the way I do
And still be on the wagon

All I need is one of your smiles
Sunshine of your eye oh me oh my
Do I feel higher than a kite can fly
Give me lovin' baby I feel high

People won't believe me
They'll think that I'm just braggin'
But I could feel the way I do
And still be on the wagon

All I need is one of your smiles
Sunshine of your eye oh me oh my
Do I feel higher than a kite can fly
Give me lovin' baby I feel high",4
"You're in for surprise
You're in for a shock
In london town streets
When there's darkness and fog
When you least expect me
And you turn your back
I'll attack

I smile when i'm sneaking
Through shadows by the wall
I laugh when i'm creeping
But you won't hear me at all

All hear my warning
Never turn your back
On the ripper

You'll soon shake with fear
Never knowing if i'm near
I'm sly and i'm shameless
Nocturnal and nameless
Except for ""the ripper""
Or if you like ""jack the knife""

Solo (glenn)

Any back alley street
Is where we'll probably meet
Underneath a gas lamp
Where the air's cold and damp
I'm a nasty surprise
I'm a devil in disguise
I'm a footstep at night
I'm a scream of the fright

All hear my warning
Never turn your back
On the ripper...the ripper....the ripper

"stranger
Last night I slept with a stranger
For the first time, since you've gone
Regretfully lying naked, I reflect on what I've done
Her leg still forced inbetween mine, sticking to my skin
Stroking my chest and my hair, head resting below my chin
I'm a fox trapped in the headlgihts
and I'm waiting, for the tyres to spin over me
Cos everything I love has gone away
Oh, cos everything I love has gone away
Oh the dark night is moving slower, and sleep wont resuce me
Leaving me here to suffer, this shameful misery
So I long for a taste of freedom, or at least freedom from this bed
Silently picking up my clothes, I turn on my heels and I fled
And the dark of the street is no solace to me
Oh and I dont believe my conscience, will ever be clear again
Cos everything I love has gone away
Oh, cos everything I love has gone away
You know in a year, it's gonna be better
You know in a year, I'm gonna be happy
You know in a year, it's gonna be better
You know in a year, I'm gonna be happy
You know in a year, it's gonna be better
You know in a year, I'm gonna be happy
You know in a year, it's gonna be better
You know in a year, I'm gonna be happy

"Touch me in the morning
And last thing at night
Keep my body warm, baby
You know it feels right

Take a little higher
I'm thinking it too
Tell me what you're feeling
I'll feel it with you

We can only understand what we are shown
How was I supposed to know our love would grow

Move a little closer
Be sure I'm looking up
Heal me with your loving
I need you, I need you, I need you so much

Touch me in the morning
And last thing at night
Keep my body warm, baby
You know it feels right

Take a little higher
I'm thinking it too
Tell me what you're feeling
I'll feel it with you

We can only understand what we are shown
How was I supposed to know our love would grow

Move a little closer
Be sure I'm looking up
Heal me with your loving
I need you, I need you, I need you so much

You touch my mind in special places
My heart races with you
I'll take your love and I'll take new chances
I'll take them with you",1
"Sun been down for days
A pretty flower in a vase
A slipper by the fireplace
A cello lying in it's case

Soon she's down the stairs
Her morning elegance she wears
The sound of water makes her dream
Awoken by a cloud of steam
She pours a daydream in a cup
A spoon of sugar sweetens up

And She fights for her life
As she puts on her coat
And she fights for her life on the train
She looks at the rain
As it pours
And she fights for her life
As she goes in a store
With a thought she has caught
By a thread
She pays for the bread
And She goes...
Nobody knows

Sun been down for days
A winter melody she plays
The thunder makes her contemplate
She hears a noise behind the gate
Perhaps a letter with a dove
Perhaps a stranger she could love

And She fights for her life
As she puts on her coat
And she fights for her life on the train
She looks at the rain
As it pours
And she fights for her life
As she goes in a store
With a thought she has caught
By a thread
She pays for the bread
And She goes...
Nobody knows
Nobody knows

And She fights for her life
As she puts on her coat
And she fights for her life on the train
She looks at the rain
As it pours
And she fights for her life
As she goes in a store
Where the people are pleasently strange
And counting the change
And She goes...
Nobody knows

Nobody knows

Nobody knows

"No more trips to Grafton Street,
No more goin’ there,
To see you lying still,
While we all come and go.

No more watching sunsets,
It seems like summer’s holding on.
And no more standing quietly at your window.

No more driving down your road,
Wond'ring when you’ll be home.
And no more peace when they all leave
And leave us two alone.

And time we always lose is finally found here with you.
My love, I know we’re losing but I will stand here by you.

No more calling friends from the car saying “I don’t know when,
I’ll be there but I’ll do my best to come.”
No more letting you warm my hands,
No more trying to take it in.
And no more saying “goodbye for the last time again”
And no more saying “goodbye for the last time again”

And time we always lose is finally found here with you.
My love, I know you’re leaving but I will stand here by you.

No more trips to Grafton Street,
No more goin’ there,
No more sitting up all night,
Waiting for any word.

Nothing’s left that’s safe here now,
Nothing will bring you home
Nothing can bring us the peace
We had in Grafton Street.

"Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light
To you everything's funny, you got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that

Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you,
won't let no one break your heart
And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up, never grow up

You're in the car on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At 14 there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday
and call your own shots
But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's getting older too
And don't lose the way
that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for school

Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
No one's ever burned you, nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to, just try to never grow up

Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone

So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder that I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my night light on

Wish I'd never grown up
I wish I'd never grown up

Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up
I could still be little
Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up
It could still be simple
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
Won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And even though you want to, please try to never grow up
Oh, don't you ever grow up
Oh, never grow up, just never grow up

"And it came to me then
that every plan is a tiny glance of father time
As I stared at my shoes in the ICU that reeked of piss and 409
And I rationed my breathes as I said to myself
that I'd already taken to much today
As each descending peak of the LCD
took you a little farther away from me
Amongst the vending machines and year old magazines
In a place where we only say goodbye

It's done like a violent limp
that out memories depend on a faulty camera in our minds
And I knew that you were truth
I would rather loved than to never lain in the sun at all

Then I looked around at all the eyes on the ground
as the TV entertained it's self
Cause there's no comfort in the waiting room
just nervous paces bracing for bad news
Then the nurse comes round and everyone lifts their head
And I'm thinking of what Sarah said but love is watching someone die

So who's going to watch you die?...

Collecting your jar of hearts
And tearing love apart

From the ice inside your soul

If I am anywhere to be found

Remember how to put back the light in my eyes
I wish I had missed
The first time that we kissed
'Cause you've broke all your promises
And now you're back
But you don't get to get me back

"Before last night my heart was grey
Like my country is today
Big kaleidoscope I see
A thousand people gaze at me
To break the ice I start to sing
About a cell called everything
A cell so big a word like small
Is suitable to say it all
Is the fighting over, I lost track
Like a wave it all comes back
Same kaleidoscope I see
Someone standing next to me
It's hard to do, it's hard to try
Hard to stop wondering why
Do I keep filing every case
When the answer's on your face
You can't see her but you do
Music is transparent too
So join me, sing with all your might
Hallelujah, praise tonight
Far away and long ago
Wintertime meant feeling low
Now every single star looks bright
God was in my bed last night",4

Am I still your charm
Or am I just bad luck

Or are we just getting more lost

I'll tell you whose is worse

And replace them with our own words

We live on front porches
And swing life away
We get by just fine here on minimum wage
If love is a labor

Until you hold my hand

I've been here so long
I think it's time to move
The winters so cold
The summers over to soon

And settle down where palm trees grow

I've got some friends
Some that I hardly know
We've had some times
I wouldn't trade for the world
We chase these days down
With talks of places that we will go

We live on front porches
And swing life away
We get by just fine here on minimum wage
If love is a labor
I'll slave till the end
I won't cross these streets
Until you hold my hand
Until you hold my hand

I throw some clothes on in the dark
The smell of cold
Car seat is freezing
The world is sleeping
I am numb
Up the stairs to her apartment
She is balled up on the couch
Her mom and dad went down to Charlotte
Theyre not home to find us out
And we drive
Now that I have found someone
Im feeling more alone
Than I ever have before
Shes a brick and Im drowning slowly
Off the coast and Im headed nowhere
Shes a brick and Im drowning slowly
They call her name at 7:30
I pace around the parking lot
Then I walk down to buy her flowers
And sell some gifts that I got
Cant you see
Its not me youre dying for
Now shes feeling more alone
Then she ever has before
Shes a brick and Im drowning slowly
Off the coast and Im headed nowhere
Shes a brick and Im drowning slowly
As weeks went by
It showed that she was not fine
They told me ""Son its time
To tell the truth""
She broke down
And I broke down
Cause I was tired of lying
Driving home to her apartment
For the moment were alone
Shes alone
Im alone
Now I know it ...

"I don't want to say goodbye
Let the stars shine through.
I don't want to say goodbye
All I want to do is love with you.
Just like the light of the morning
After the darkness has gone
The shadow of my love is falling
On a place where the sun always shone.
Don't you know that's where our hearts both belong?
'Cause I don't want to say goodbye.
Let the stars shine through.
No, I don't want to say goodbye
All I want to do is live with you.

Together our two hearts are strong
Don't you know know that's where our hearts both belong?

"I am stuck in L.A.
Through the week and can't get away
And you're alone on the pier
In West Palm Beach on your holiday
Stormy night, reawake
the stomach ache that i've acquired
from feeling down, things look grim
and i'm so sick of being tired
apartment lights go dark
and it's depressing but what can i do?
the midnight streets feel dead
when i am so used to driving with you
brighter lights fill the night and
bluer skys reflect in your eyes
As I inspect and analyze
All of these dreams I don't recognize
if you're still up when the ships
in the port prepare to set sail
comb the beach and put those blue flowers up in your ponytail
inside my head
you're voice is still resounding but what can i do?
Empty rooms feel cold when I am so used to being with you
Count the stars, watch the waves absorb the summer sun
and think of me
when you explore hidden coves and tiny island chains throughout the sea
Can you still
hear my voice
when I'm outside from over the phone
For what its worth
darling dear
I wish you were here
Cause I feel alone
when you were home we'd sing but since you've left I don't hear anything
Though I feel so sad, I can't believe things are really that bad
Old captains and brand new cruise ships
Sailing over the briney sea
When I crashed my beloved desk job
And swim through the debris
I'll cut loose leave this mad house,bound for the Atlantic blue
I'll stroll down your treelined driveway
and sail the ocean with you
Happy Chinese Valentine's Day!

Aren't you getting tired of me?
Whinging, overdrawn

Faceless, blind
Want to take her out again
She's not just mine
Want to take her out again

In a bodiless embrace
Thriving, I have grown
Fickle. changing grip, replaced
Choking, take it all

Faceless, blind

Dedicated, true to form
Still the only one

"Verse One: Big Boi

In the zone like Keyser Soze, always the Usual Suspect
No check, all I got in this game is my respect
And Southern pride I be, checkin' my fuckin' head
Scared, lookin' up in your face, boi I see dead
If you test like SAT, then I guess that we may be, enemies
In the P's freestyles be freebies
I be that wrong nigga to fuck with, wouldn't I
Wouldn't I be the wrong one to try, never eating chicken thighs
Only the twenty piece mojo, flow zone like Flo Jo
I wanted to figure out, just how low could yo' hoe go
The beat hit like Beat Street, Krush Groove and Breakin
Never bakin, rebukin Satan, we had you waitin
For the Second Coming funny how time flies when you're rhymin
La-Fa-Ce records, I think they got that perfect timin
To be doper than Sadaam believe the Nation of Islam
Fuck the police and the dogs, sniffin that dope up out your car
I think they overstep they boundaries
O.J., not guilty, that's how they found he

Verse Two: Andre

I felt the pressure like sun shinin, while raining at the same time
I kept on rhymin, not complainin
Storm bringing cats and dogs my catalog be the size of golf balls
Throw up your Daisy Dukes I'm Hazzard-ous to all you Boss Hoggs
And Roscoe P. Col' people, who could boost my locomotive
But enough of that everyone can rap unless they ain't supposed ta
I use my gift of gab to boast and brag in every rhyme I
Compose won't y'all get sick of that, 'cause I know I do when I hear those
Flows that ain't hip-hop, you find that shit in the gift shop
But to each his own, my speech is gon', keep that shit up outta my zone
Long as you happy then I'm happy
Even if you just hate my fuckin' guts go 'head and dap me

"There are some nights I hold on
to every note I ever wrote
Some nights, I say ""f*ck it all""
and stare at the calendar
Waiting for catastrophes,
imagine when they'd scare me
Into changing whatever
it is I am changing into...

And you have every right to be scared.

Cause there are some nights I hold you close,
pushing you to hold me
Or begging you to lock me up,
never let me see the world
Some nights, I live in horror
of people on the radio
Tea parties and Twitter,
I've never been so bitter
And you, why you wanna stay?
Oh my God! Have you listened to me lately?
Lately, I've been going crazy...
And you, why you wanna stay?
Oh my God! Have you listened to me lately?
Lately, I've been f*cking crazy...
There are some nights I wait
for someone to save us
But I never look inward,
try not to look upward
And some nights I pray
a sign is gonna come to me
But usually, I'm just trying to get some sleep...

Some nights!

and we saw your story
all the burn-ups and bruises on your body
you took your shirt off for the swimming race
you just kept swimming

I know the ocean speaks (The stars retreat behind their veil)
I've heard her call to me (The clouds are clinging to your sail)
And smiling in my dreams (The storm is coming, can you see?)
She whispers this:

""Can you see the sky turn red
As morning's light breaks over me?
Know tonight we'll make our bed

Look and see the sky turn red

And soon the sea shall give up her dead
We'll raise an empire from the bottom of the sea.",2

We can always play by ear
But that's the deal my dear

Lucky that my lips not only mumble
They spill kisses like a fountain
Lucky that my breasts are small and humble
So you don't confuse them with mountains
Lucky that I have strong legs like my mother
To run to cover when I need it
And these two eyes that for no other
The day you leave will cry a river
Le do le le le le , Le do le le le le
At your feet ,I'm at your feet
Whenever, Wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there and you'll be near
And that's the deal my dear

You'll never have to wonder
We can always play by ear

Tell me one more time
That you'll live
Lost in my eyes

Whenever, Wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there and you'll be near
And that's the deal my dear
Thereover, Hereunder
You've got me head over heals
There's nothing left to fear
If you really feel the I feel
Whenever, Wherever
We're meant together
I'll be ther and you'll be near

"And I still love him tonight
No distance or time can bite
And I still feel out of place
In crowded rooms
And the silence of space

No love could be
This hard to beat
I still read your star signs
Star signs

And they know just when to hit
When morning comes and your friends
They gotta split
And you know just what to say
When no one's around you know how to play

No love could be this hard
To beat
I still read your star signs, star signs

Baby, baby can't you see
This world ain't big enough for you or me so
Light the candles and turn out your lights
And turn on my lights

No love could be this hard to beat
I still read your star signs, star signs

What you mean

I don't even know what you mean

All over my world and
When I think of all the things you've done for me
Your love rains down
All over my land

You promised me your love
I promised you my time
We can take this love to heaven
If you just put your hand in mine
Girl my life never began
Until you showed me how to trust
At times I was afraid
But still you showed me
True love
True love, baby

I promise I, I promise I wont change
Babe I'm gonna be, I gotta be the same man you met
But that won't work unless you're here with me baby
Cause you complete, you complete the man I am

Ohh love Ohh love
I promised you my time I promised ohh love my time
Heaven
Hand in mine
My life never began
Until you showed me how to trust
At times I was afraid
Showed me
True love

I appreciate your gift to me, I do
I'm the man I am today because of you
I am not the man I used to be
Was blind, but now these eyes can see
This love will keep us strong throughout the years

You promised me your love
We can take this love to heaven
If you just give me your hand
If you just put your hand in mine

"You think you've made it everythings going so fine
But then appears someone who wanna
Tear you down
Wanna rip you off those few nice things you've found
When and if you hit the ground.
Then its falling kinda hard
Cause all you do is being yourself
Trying everything to succeed somehow.
But thats not the way things are right now.
Feeling kinda lost.

Those reasons
Those unkind words being expressed
Oh… theyll get to you I promise one day.
But maybe then its too late for you to say
I knew it from the go cause you know
Thats some miles away from the truth.
Dont forget

Hey what do you think of me now
Am I not like I once were
Still if you dont know me
Whats the story of this pen
I guess youre not a stranger
And I can tell you're not a friend
It might take a while but I guess youll manage waiting till then.
Then when you confront me with your thought

You may think I dont notice dont get a bit hurt by what you do
I ask you to please think of
What Ive done to you.
Please search inside and let me know
If I've done something wrong I guess I'll go
Far hidden
Never to be found.

just let me know

If you need a shoulder to cry on

When you need a healer for your pain

When you need someone to love you
Here I am, hmmm

If you have broken dreams
Just lay them all on me
I'll be the one who understands
So take my hand

You know I'll do my best
To fill you up with all the love
That I can show someone

"when we were making the first Linkin Park record
He was like,
""Yeah you know, I don't know about the rapping like,
I don't know... maybe you should just be a rock band.""
You know what I mean, like, trying to change us
like they signed us as an act like what we sound like and then he's like
""Oh I don't know maybe you should just play keyboard""

Before the first song that you heard me on
There were people already tryin' to get me gone
Tellin' me to quit rapping
""Just play the keys""
That my band had a singer
They didn't need me
But my band had my back
So we did the tracks
Put out the album and the talk went flat
It was funny at first but then the humour faded
When some magazines printed that our label made us
We were to be good to be true
Some were saying ghost writers were writin' all that we do
So we had to disprove it
We spelled it out to the detail how we do it when we're making this music
After that I made it a rule
I only do e-mail responses to print interviews
Because these people love to put a twist to your words
To infer that you said something fucking absurd

Oh, did I lose you at infer?
Not used to hearing a verse that uses over first grade vocabulary words?
People used to infer that we were manufactured
Now I've got the interviews on file
Which people said what
Which number to dial
So now every enemy screaming insanity
All they're ever gonna be's another big fan of me

Living it up when the rent was due
With nothing and no one to live up to

Holding hands and drinking wine

Twelve bars behind us
And twelve bars to go
Bottles of beer lined up in a row
One for each hour you didn't show

Getting high just to pass away

All I have, all I need, he's the air I would kill to breathe
Holds my love in his hands, still I'm searching for something
Out of breath, I am left hoping someday I'll breathe again
I'll breathe again

Open up next to you and my secrets become your truth
And the distance between that was sheltering me comes in full view
Hang my head, break my heart built from all I have torn apart
And my burden to bear is a love I can't carry anymore

On a lonely highway

Turn around the heartache

As for me, I am poor and destitute. Hashem my G-d will think about me. My help, my rescuer, you are.

My word is like a hammer like a shattering rock,
Crack through your heart and take the evil apart

From the end of the earth unto you I call, time and again I fall, back to you I crawl
You have been a refuge for me, a tower of strength in the face of the enemy
Enemy, enemy lines I find I let myself get tied up too many times
You can't have my heart I'm taking back what's mine
I know it lie just smoke in your eye and you saved my soul from the other side

When faint grows my heart to a rock that too hard for me to climb alone lead me
For you have been a refuge

With you I smash a troop and with my G-d I leap over a wall
May the king answer you on the day that you call
Stand tall, battle yawl, the clouds crawl low, all stalled,
Heavens lay draped over New York like a prayer shawl,
The holy one enthroned upon the praises of Israel

Pathways of my heart clogged like a traffic jam
From the start, I want to take the blockage apart",4

I'll get it second hand, I'm dazed and confused

Turn back the second hand, I pay all my dues

I got rid of my dues and I'm all fixed up
Watch me talk about it, wooo

Second hand, yeah used, second hand

I got it second hand, all used up

Second hand

Second hand......

"I entered the room
Sat by your bed all through the night
I watched your daily fight
I hardly knew
The pain was almost more than I could bear
And still I hear
Your last words to me

Heaven is a place nearby
So I wont be so far away
And if you try and look for me
Maybe you will find me someday
Heaven is a place nearby
So there is no need to say goodbye
I wanna ask you not to cry
I will always be by your side

You just faded away
You spread your wings you had flown
Away to something unknown
Wish I could bring you back
You are always on my mind
About to tear myself apart.
You have your special place in my heart

Always heaven is a place nearby
So I wont be so far away
And if you try and look for me
Maybe you will find me someday
Heaven is a place nearby
So there is no need to say goodbye
I wanna ask you not to cry
I’ll always be by your side

And even when I go to sleep
I still can hear your voice
And those words
I never will forget

Heaven is a place nearby
So I wont be so far away
And if you try and look for me
Maybe you will find me someday
Heaven is a place nearby
So there is no need to say goodbye
I wanna ask you not to cry
I will always be by your side

"Leave the light on
Said mom and poppa do
Leave the light on
And I'm coming home to you
Cause I get scared
In the dark at night
And I can't find my key
So leave the light on for me
Tuck me in babe
Just like you always do
Tuck me in babe
So tight and close to you
Cause I get cold in my dreams at night
And I'm reaching out for you
So tuck me in babe, do
La da....
Give me love, love
I say to all of you
Give me sweet love
And I give it back to you
You get tired and you fall down
I'll bend low to pick you up
So give me love, love
Give me love, love, love

"Dear diary
Today I saw a boy
And I wondered if he noticed me
He took my breath away

Dear diary
I can't get him off my mind
And it scares me
Cause I've never felt this way

No one in this world
Knows me better than you do
So diary I'll confide in you

Dear diary
Today I saw a boy
As he walked by I thought he smiled at me

And I wondered
Does he know what's in my heart
I tried to smile, but I could hardly breathe

Should I tell him how I feel
Or would that scare him away
Diary, tell me what to do
Please tell me what to say

Dear diary
One touch of his hand
Now I can't wait to see that boy again

He smiled
And I thought my heart could fly
Diary, do you think that we'll be more than friends?
Eee……
I've got a feeling we'll be so much more than friends

" And Aubrey was her name,
 a not so very ordinary girl or name.
 But who's to blame for a love that wouldn't bloom
 for the hearts that never played in tune.
 Like a lovely melody that everyone can sing,
 take away the words that rhyme it doesn't mean a thing.
And Aubrey was her name.
 We triped the light and danced togther to the moon,
 but where was June. No it never came around.
 If it did it never made a sound,
 maybe I was absent or was listening to fast,
 catching all the words, but then the meaning going past,
 but god I miss the girl, and I'd go a thousand
times around the world just to be closer the her than to me.
And Aubrey was her name,
 I never new her, but I loved her just the same,
 I loved her name.
 Wish that I had found the way
 and the reasons that would make her stay.
 I have learned to lead a life apart from all the rest.
 If I can't have the one I want , I'll do without the best.
 But how I miss the girl and I'd go a million
times around the world just to say she had been mine for a day,

"Living in a bedsit
Close to the world's end,
Sitting in his y-fronts
Sponging off his girlfriend Caaaaarey
She says life's right there babe
Should be getting on with it
xxx better tell her that you've all but squandered it
It's siiiilly

And his relatives all think that it's a shame
And they'd say that it's a mystery if his Dad wasn't exactly the same
The same

He's been a space cadet for years
Says one day he'll be an astronaut
Floating in the hemisphere
And looking down on Hampton Court
But he's always late
And knows one day he'll graduate
Then he'll be floating in the ozone
High above the empire
High above the empire
State state state state
He's living in a
State state state state
He's in a proper
State state state state
They've got him in a
State state state state

Sofa sufer, likes a little gamble
A few dodgy debts that he says he can handle
Maaaaaybe
Never not xxx
Stays in most nights
Jostling to pixelated princesses on websites
Franticly

And his family all say that it's a waste
And they wash their mouths out with self righteousness
To hide the bitter taste
The taste

He's been a space cadet for years
Says one day he'll be an astronaut
Floating in the hemisphere
And looking down on Hampton Court
But he's always late
And knows one day he'll graduate
Then he'll be floating in the ozone
High above the empire
High above the empire
Carey's love is cold and congealed
Like last night's take-away
And she feels
She might have to do some kind
Of midnight flit
All there is to say has been said
And as the sky's turning pink
She leaves her keys by the sink
And takes one last look at our hero's face
He's been a space cadet for years
Says one day he'll be an astronaut
Floating in the hemisphere
And looking down on Hampton Court
But he's always late
And knows one day he'll graduate
Then he'll be floating in the ozone
High above the empire
High above the empire

"You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take
You take the very best of me
So I start a fight cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want
Cause I'm not what you wanted
Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending given to a perfect day
 just walk away
No use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
And I stood there loving you and washed
them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you
Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending given to a perfect day
So just walk away
No use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You never did give a damn thing, honey
But I cried, cried for you
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died
Died for you (died for you)
Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending give to a perfect day
Every smile you fake is so condescending
Counted all the scars you made
Now that I'm sitting her thinking it through

"The islander slips into hiding
And takes to his heels
Out of dark Northland
The murky house of Sara
He whirled out of doors as snow
Arrives as smoke in the yard
To flee from bad deeds

There he had to become someone else
He must change his shape
As an eagle he swept up
Wanted to soar heavenward
The sun burnt his cheeks
The moon lit his brows",2

"What you see's not what you get
With you there's just no measurement
No way to tell what's real from what isn't there
Your eyes they sparkle
That's all changed into lies that drop like acid rain
You washed away the best of me
You don't care
You know you did it
I'm gone
To find someone to live for
In this world
There's no light at the end of the tunnel tonight
Just a bridge that I gotta burn
You're wrong
If you think you can walk right through my door
That is just so you
Coming back when I've finally moved on
I'm already gone
Sometimes shattered
Never open
Nothing matters
When you're broken
That was me whenever I was with you
Always ending
Always over
Back and forth, up and down like a rollercoaster
I am breaking
That habit
Today
You know you did it
I'm gone
To find someone to live for
In this world
There's no light at the end of the tunnel tonight
Just a bridge that I gotta burn
You're wrong
If you think you can walk right through my door
That is just so you
Coming back when I've finally moved on
I'm already gone
There is nothing you can say
Sorry doesn't cut it, babe
Take the hint and walk away
'Cause I'm gone
Doesn't matter what you do
It's what you did that's hurting you
All I needed was the truth
Now I'm gone
What you see's not what you get
What you see's not what you get
You know you did it
I'm gone
To find someone to live for
In this world
There's no light at the end of the tunnel tonight
Just a bridge that I gotta burn
You were wrong
If you think you can walk right through my door
That is just so you
Coming back when I've finally moved on

Oh, I'm already gone, gone, gone, gone
Already gone

"You can have Manhattan
I know it’s for the best
I’ll gather up the avenues
And leave them on your doorstep
And I’ll tip toe away
So you won’t have to say
You heard me leave

You can have Manhattan
I know it’s what you want
The bustle and the buildings
The weather in the fall
And I’ll bow out of place
To save you some space
For somebody new

You can have Manhattan
Cause I can’t have you

Ahhhhh

You can have Manhattan
The one we used to share
The one where we were laughing
And drunk on just being there
Hang on to the reverie
Could you do that for me?
Cause I’m just too sad to

You can have Manhattan
Cause I can’t have you

And so it goes
One foot after the other
Til black and white begin to color in
And I know
That holding us in place
Is simply fear of what’s already changed

Ahhhhh

You can have Manhattan
I’ll settle for the view
The sunsets facing westward
The sand beneath my feet
And I’ll wish this away
Just missing the days
When I was one half of two
You can have Manhattan
Cause I can’t have you

Over the hill
Come here with me

Into the wild

On my way
See the change (Rearrange)

High above the serpentine
I cross below the well-worn lines
Entangled in a missing memory
A violent oversight
A formless order will give rise
To something some new world is here to seize

Over the hill
Come here with me

Drifting, drifting, drifting, drifting by, totally. Drifting
By (just) totally. Drifting by (just) totally

Q-Tip:
The deadly venom, let me start from the beginning
We always hittin, so yo, there'll be no extra innings
As I send the mic out the park like Reggie Jackson
You be the minor leaguer who sees no action
The coming attraction (what!)
The main feature
And I'm a greet ya, like a rhymin ass creature
Lurking all up in the dark, unknown parts
The brotha well prepared is the brotha who will start
And that's me Aqui, as long as the ladies move they bodies
We'll have a forum to stand
'Cause that happens to be the nature of man
Sexuality, it is the format baby
Ain't no ifs, no buts, no ands, or maybes
But I praise Lord in the worlds that's unseen
Respect me for that and let me do my thing (just)
I said, respect me for that and let me do my thing

(Drifting by) You know we gotta get a hold
(Suddenly) Over the illest drum rolls
(Suddenly drifting by just...)

Yo, how you doin'? Let me give you an intro
My name's the Abstract, now let me give you some info
Got the diamond in the back, and the sunroof shit
That makes the hardcore MCs resort to being bitch
And I don't give a shit about being wild rich
Just make me comfortable and I'll deal with it
Your lust for the riches make a nigga feel sick
Down to his zealots, upchuck and then spit
Denouncin my beliefs, well then your wig get split
Lay your ego on the ground so that you'll benefit
You can take these words and relay it to your click
Take some time for your mind and get off them head trips
Don't try to play me, see my name's not dick
The Tribe is the crew that makes your mics get lit
Like the Fourth of July on some firework shit
My record company be on some true jerk shit
But that's i-ight. Now, I'm on some true work shit
And I'ma make it happen for my whole outfit

(Drifting by) You know we got to get control
(Suddenly) Over the illest drum rolls
(Suddenly drifting by just...) Third verse

A-yo, we just gettin' started
Got to redirect this vision
Got the beauty of a flower
Plus dimensions like a prism
Your minds are locked down like prison
Y'all really need to go lay down
'Cause positivity has risen
We hittin
Yo bust how we too strong to be broken
Occasional malfunction pressure time
We ain't jokin
For security we on this run like Logan
Kamaal's doin' the hustle
And you backstage voguin
We all got flaws
Don't ever try to think that you perfect
We all are human beings
There's bullshit at the surface
Sometimes, I mean we rhyme
Damn, we ain't prophets
And if you think so, you need to stop it
So jump back inside your shell
Let your million dollar thoughts propel
But next man don't get jel
Playa hate that all carries weight
That we don't need
We slim with disabilities and
Thick with possibilities
'Cause then you can't move with agility
Navigatin with good visibility
We put these tunes out in record shop facilities
Let's strive to get this constant money activity
We try to stay on the scene like Fidel
So if you get enraged with these names it still rebels
There ain't no plan B's
Yo watch, we movin through with plan A
Money market doin' things the right way

Child is slowly taken

And their bombs, and their guns

With their tanks ,and their bombs

How I wish she was still right here with me

Like old Hank Williams when he'd sing about lonesome
And Hag about misery and gin

And the bartender said it's closing time

Oh I wonder if she's having trouble sleeping
And if those songs keep on runnin' through her mind

"It's strange to think
The songs we used to sing
The smiles
The flowers
Everything is gone

Yesterday, I found out about you
Even though I'm just looking at you
Feels wrong
You say that you'd take it all back
Given one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said, ""yes""

You should have said no
You should have gone home
You should have thought twice before you let it all go
You should have known the word
That what you did with her would get to me
I should have been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should have said no
Baby, and you might still have me

You can see that I've been crying
Baby, you know all the right things to say
But, do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?
You say that the past is the past
You need one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said, ""yes""

You should have said no
You should have gone home
You should have thought twice before you let it all go
You should have known the word
That what you did with her would get to me
I should have been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should have said no
Baby, and you might still have me

Oh, I can't resist
Before you go
Tell me this
Was it worth it
Was she worth this?
No, no, no, no, no

You should have said no
You should have gone home
You should have thought twice before you let it all go
You should have known the word
That what you did with her would get to me
I should have been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should have said no
Baby, and you might still have me",2

"I hear this old story before
If people keep appealing for the metaphors
Don't leave much up to the imagination
So I, wanna give this imagery back
No it just aint so easy like that
I turn the page and read the story again
And again and again
just seems the same, with a diff  name
breaking and rebuilding
And we're growing
Always guessing
Never knowing
Shocking but we're nothing
We're just moments
We're Clever but we're clueless
We're just human
Amusing but confusing
Were trying but where is this all leading
Never Know

It all happened so much faster
Than you could say disaster
Wanna take a time lapse
And look at it backwards
From the last one
And maybe thats just the answer
That we're after
But after all
We're just a bubble in a boiling pot
Just one breath in a chain of thought
The moments just combusting
Feel certain but we'll never never know
Just seems the same
Give it a diff. name
beggin and we're needing
And we're trying and we're breathing
Never knowing
Shocking but we're nothing
We're just moments
We're Clever but we're clueless
We're just human
Amusing but confusing
Helping, we're builign
And we're growing
Never Know

Knock knock on the door to door
Tell ya that the metaphor is better than yours
And you can either sink or swim
Things are looking pretty grim
If you dont believe in what this one feeding
Its got no feeling
So I read it again
And again and again
Just seems the same
Too many different names
Our hearts are strong our hands are weak
We'll always be competing
Never knowing
Shocking but we're nothing
We're just moments
We're Clever but we're clueless
We're just human
Amusing but confusing
But the truth is
All we got is questions
We'll Never Know
Never Know

Under dreaming spires

Seems the more I gave, the less I got

All you get is pain
When I needed sunshine, I got rain

Follow me into the trees

Bring some alcohol

Promise I will be forever yours
Promise not to say another word
Nevermind what's done is done
Always was a lucky one

Watch the sunrise all alone
Sitting on the tracks
Hear the train come roaring in
Never coming back

Laying quiet in the grass
Everything is still
River stones and broken bones
Scattered on the hill

Promise I will be forever yours
Promise not to say another word
Nevermind what's done is done
Always was a lucky one

Promise I will be forever yours
Promise not to say another word
Here forever deep beneath the dirt
Nevermind what's done is done

"My heart is so proud.
My mind is so unfocused.
I see the things You do through me
As great things I have done
And now You gently break me,
Then lovingly You take me 
And hold me as my Father and mold me as my Maker.
I ask You: ""How many times will You pick me up,
When I keep on letting You down?
And each time I will fall short of Your glory,
How far will forgiveness abound?""
And You answer: ""My child, I love you.
And as long as you're seeking My face,
You'll walk in the power of My daily sufficient grace

At times I may grow weak
and feel a bit discouraged,
Knowing that someone,
somewhere Could do a better job.
For who am I to serve You?
I know I don't deserve You.
And that's the part that burns in my heart
And keeps me hanging on
I ask You: ""How many times will You pick me up,
When I keep on letting You down?
And each time I will fall short of Your glory,
How far will forgiveness abound?""
And You answer: ""My child, I love you
And as long as you're seeking My face,
You'll walk in the power of My daily sufficient grace
you are so Patient with me, Lord.

As I work with You, I'm learning
what Your grace really means.
The price that I could never pay
was paid at Calvary.
So, instead of trying to repay You,
I'm learning to simply obey You
By giving up my life to You For all that giving to me
I ask You: ""How many times will You pick me up,
When I keep on letting You down?
And each time I will fall short of Your glory,
How far will forgiveness abound?""
And You answer: ""My child, I love you.
And as long as you're seeking My face,

"Born from some mother's womb
Just like any other room
Made a promise for a new life
Made a victim out of your life

When your time's on the door
And it drips to the floor
And you feel you can touch
All the noise is too much
And the seeds that are sown
Are no longer your own

Just a minor operation
To force a final ultimatum
Thousand words are spoken loud
Reach the dumb to fool the crowd

When you walk down the street
And the sound's not so sweet
And you wish you could hide
Maybe go for a ride
To some peep show arcade
Where the future's not made

A nightmare situation
Infiltrate imagination
Smacks of past Holy wars
By the wall with broken laws

The leaders of men
Born out of your frustration
The leaders of men
Just a strange infatuation
The leaders of men
Made a promise for a new life
No saviour for our sakes
To twist the internees of hate
Self induced manipulation
To crush all thoughts of mass salvation",2
"Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down...

Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
We all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
But the battle wages on for toy soldiers

I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I am never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter
I'd never drag them in battles
that I can handle unless I absolutely have to
I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever just pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
Now Ja said ""I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it""
There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, this shit be way beyond some Jay-z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent too much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it
That was never my object for someone to get killed
Why would I wanna destroy something I help build
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions was good
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin' (?)
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
While he's all over t.v. down talkin' a man who literally saved my life
Like fuck it i understand this is business
And this shit just isn't none of my business
But still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute cuz

And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
But now it's elevated cuz once you put someone's kids in it
The shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?
It's a different ball game, callin' names and you ain't just rappin'
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him
Fuck it 50 smash 'em, mash 'em and let him have it
Meanwhile my attention is pullin' in other directions
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his ressurection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up cuz one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'
Well fuck it, that mutherfucker can get it too, fuck him then
But I'm so busy being pissed off I don't stop to think
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.
And he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind
We still have soldiers that's on the front line
That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
We'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
To show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is
To have run ya nav and who sulked us up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt and murdered
There ain't words that I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Then to just say that I love ya'll too much to see the virdict
I'll walk away from it all before I let it go any further
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'
I'm just willin' to be the bigger man
If ya'll can quit poppin' off at your jaws with the knockin'
Cuz frankly I'm sick of talkin'
I'm not gonna let someone elses coffin rest on my conscience cuz

We sat side by side and held hands for some time
We saluted the Statue of Liberty

Everything is new and so unpredictable
I should just kick my heels together and go home
But I'm not sure where that is anymore

Oh how I wish I could go back in time
To the night when I heard my mother cry
She held me in her arms and we talked for some time
And I sang a song her mother sang to her
And it goes something about paper dolls and what men prefer
Something about the cross and how her Jesus died for her
Something about love and how it's worth living for
I wonder does love like that exist anymore?

I have much farther to go
I'm so confused I know
I should just kick my heels together and go home

And you're not there to lay next to me

Without you, this World
Is nothing but lonely wilderness

I want to blend with your smell
And colour, and be your part

A thief or a seductress
You are a dancer, but(you) make people dance
No one has understood untill(now)

Pure bloodline to perfection
Father after father
Never to see a drawning sun

Not alone
Never alone
All above are enemies
A means to perfection
Unholy demons of the mind

Clench the fist to signal
To initiate the final
The end - The killing begins
Rapid torrent leather wings

Pulling swords from the sheathe
Hack down the hindrance
Create your own path
There shall be no remembrance

Unearthy
Unholy

Who gather at the smell of blood
Many are we
Who gather at the sound of war

Corroded ruined wrecked
The dead sky shines through smoke and fog
Scorched black empty
Life not wanted
Blood brown smell of muck

Many are we
Who gather at the sound of war",1

A nightingale no longer singing

You're still clinging to that notion

In the night, in the night

Want the same thing when we lay
Otherwise mine's a different way

So sorry if I turn my head

But that don't make your place safe

Of what we had could be intruded
But I couldn't let it be
I needed it as much as you did

Why we just speak at night 
The only time I hold your hand
Is to get the angle right

Well no one can love you more than i love you now, but i

Gotta go running for the bus
Coat flying and i try not to miss it this time
But the drivers waiting and that’s strange
Kids on the top deck quiet for a change
And there’s no rain and no roadworks
In the bus lane and all my hurts run away
And im smiling as i’m punching in

Everything will be alright
The day i died was the best day of my life

And the in-tray on my desks almost empty
I get a memo from executive joe
Saying Rob the gob is getting kicked out
For embezzling funds from the company account
And id be lying if i said i wasn’t chuffed
Cos i always hated rob
And now they’ll probably offer me robs old job

And in the park at lunch
There’s no whinos on my favorite bench
None of that drunk chatter none of that pissy stench
And the scrawny little pigeons with the gammy legs
Decide to dive bomb from someone else’s sandwich instead
And there’s something about the city today
Like all the colors conspire to overwhelm the grey
And this close to the fire i can feel no cold
Put a rainbow halo around my soul

Should i wait for another no i cant be arsed
I begin to walk
And rush hour crowd seem to part like the red sea
And i’m stopping at the offy
20 cigarettes and a 6 pack to relax me
And as i cross back over the street
I guess i never saw that taxi

In every single way
And more each passing day
You are brighter than the stars
Believe me when I say
It's not about your scars
It's all about your heart

Like a lock without a key
Like a mystery without a clue
There is no me if I cannot have you

Oh, I´ve loved you from the start
In every single way

And more each passing day
You are brighter than the stars
Believe me when I say
It's not about your scars
It's all about your heart

It's all about your heart

"Living and dying laughing and crying
Once you have seen it you will never be the same
Life in the fast lane is just how it seems
Hard and it is heavy dirty and mean
Motorbreath
Its how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath
The sign of living fast
It is going to take
Your breath away
Don't stop for nothing its full speed or nothing
I am taking down you know whatever is in my way
Getting your kicks as you are shooting the line
Sending the shivers up and down your spine
Motorbreath
Its how I live my life
I can't take it any other way
Motorbreath
The sign of living fast
It is going to take
Your breath away
Those people who tell you not to take chances
They are all missing on what life is about
You only live once so take hold of the chance
Don't end up like others the same song and dance

Its how I live my life
I can't take it any other way

It is going to take

"I keep my lid on tightly
I dress the part and smile
But something's stirring underneath
It's been brewing there a while
Pacing my halls on tiptoes
Sitting, I twiddle my thumbs
Making a break when the bell goes
How fast can these legs run?
I'm free
Free as a bird
I'm free
Free as a bird
I'm tired of all your stories
'Bout what you've seen and done
Wagging your finger back at me
Why don't you bite your tongue?
Cutting around the corners
Traipsing through back alleys
Doing exactly what I want
Don't care what you think of me
I'm free
Free as a bird
I'm free
Free as a bird
Like a word
That leaves my mind
Like a dream
Leaves in daylight
I've waited a long, long while now
Bided my time for this
Traded my suits for cowboy boots
For something I wouldn't dare miss
Keepin' my fingers crossed now
Keepin' my toes crossed too
If I blink and find I'm dreamin'
I don't know what I would do

Till I destroy you
I hate everyone
Don't know what to do
Ingesting flesh and bone
Makes me a cannibal

Horrible

Sucking on colorforms
Becoming see through
Still hating everyone
As I detest you
I do not feel wrong
This makes me durable
Or am I criminal
I'm so damn horrible

And everything is horrible
Horrible

Fade into yesterday
Searching for my youth
Trying to digest it all
Searching for the truth
Self centered devil spawn

"Honey lovin you is the greatest thing
I get to be myself and I get to sing
I get to play at being irresponsible
I come home late at night and I love your soul
I never forget you in my prayers
I never have a bad thing to report
You’re my picture on the wall
You’re my vision in the hall
You’re the one I’m talking to
When I get in from my work
You are my girl, and you don’t even know it
I am livin out the life of a poet
I am the jester in the ancient court
You’re the funny little frog in my throat
My eye sight’s fading, my hearing’s dim
I can’t get insured for the state I’m in
I’m a danger to myself I’ve been starting fights
At the party at the club on a Saturday night
But I don’t get disapproving from my girl
She gets the all highlights wrapped in pearls..
You’re my picture on the wall
You’re my vision in the hall
You’re the one I’m talking to
When I get in from my work
You are my girl, and you don’t even know it
I am livin out the life of a poet
I am the jester in the ancient court
You’re the funny little frog in my throat
I had a conversation with you at night
It’s a little one sided but that’s allright
I tell you in the kitchen about my day
You sit on the bed in the dark changing places
With the ghost that was there before you came
You’ve come to save my life again
I don’t dare to touch your hand
I don’t dare to think of you
In a physical way
And I don’t know how you smell
You are the cover of my magazine
You’re my fashion tip, a living museum
I’d pay to visit you on rainy Sundays
I’ll maybe tell you all about it someday

And it's simply irrational weather
I can't even hear myself think
Constantly bailing out water
But still feel like I'm gonna sink

Just like the world
So sorry for being so bold
When I turn out the light
You're out of sight
Although I know that I'm not alone
Feels like home
Feels like home

You say you feel like a natural person
You haven't got nothing to hide
So why do you feel imperfection
Cut like a sword in your side

'Cause you're under the weather
Just like the world
So sorry for being so bold
When I turn out the light
You're out of sight
Although I know that I'm not alone
Feels like home

Feels like home
Feels like home
Feels like home
Yes it feels like home
Yes it feels like home

When I turn out the light
You're out of sight

Been searching for the higher ground in me.
And I've been trying to surrender,
To trust in every word.

Someone could have taken them from me.

Tell me how you feel.

But I'd be giving it all away.

"Lord, I had a woman
Lord knows she was good to me in every way
Yes, I had a woman
A real woman
Lord, she gave me lovin' both night and day
My sun shine
Woo hoo
For my woman
Or else or else
It's going to take me one more day
If it takes me
She went way down in Dallas
Way down in Texas land
Lord she had me wrapped around her wrist and around her finger baby
Like a ring wrapped around a finger of a severed hand
I'm lookin' for my Dallas honey bee
Where can you be
Where can you be
Ooh hoo hoo help me
Help me look for her
Oh yeah",2
"They sat together in the park
As the evening sky grew dark
She looked at him and he felt a spark
Tingle to his bones
'Twas then he felt alone
And wished that he'd gone straight
And watched out for a simple twist of fate

They walked alone by the old canal
A little confused, I remember well
And stopped into a strange hotel
With a neon burning bright
He felt the heat of the night
Hit him like a freight-
Train moving with a simple twist of fate

A saxophone someplace far off played
As she was walking on by the arcade
As the light bust through a beat up shade
Where he was waking up
She dropped a coin into the cup
Of a blind man at the gate
And forgot about a simple twist of fate

He woke up; the room was bare
He didn't see her anywhere
He told himself he didn't care
Pushed the window open wide
Felt an emptiness inside
To which he just could not relate
Brought on by a simple twist of fate

He hears the ticking of the clocks
And walks along with a parrot that talks
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks
Where the sailors all come in
Maybe she'll pick him out again
How long must he wait
One more time for a simple twist of fate

People tell me it's a sin
To know and feel too much within
I still believe she was my twin
But I lost the ring
She was born in spring
But I was born too late
Blame it on a simple twist of fate",2

And I know it's long gone, and magics not here no more
And I might be okay, but i'm not, found it all

Wind in my air I was there I remember it all too well

Photo album on my counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with your glasses in a twin size bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on a tivo team
You tell me about your past thinking your future was me

And I know it's long gone, and there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed you

Cause here we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs I was there I remember it all too well

And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing wasn't masterpiece

Running scared, I was there I remember it all too well

So casually cruel in the name of being honest

But your keep my old scarf from that very first week
Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it, cause you remember it all too well

Cause there we are again and I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known

"oh, i could hide 'neath the wings
Of the bluebird as she sings.
The six o'clock alarm would never ring.
Whoops its ringing and i rise,
Wipe the sleep out of my eyes.
My shavin' razor's cold and it stings.

Cheer up, sleepy jean.
Oh, what can it mean.
To a daydream believer
And a homecoming queen.

You once thought of me
As a white knight on a steed.
Now you know how happy i can be.
Oh, and our good times starts and end
Without dollar one to spend.
But how much, baby, do we really need.

Cheer up, sleepy jean.
Oh, what can it mean.
To a daydream believer
And a homecoming queen.

"Still, somewhere inside me,
there is a little life remaining..
A new heartbeat came up,
I got to know that I am still alive..
Some such tenacity
is there in this moment,
where was this moment of mine..
now it's in front of me,
should I die or should I live a little..
should I kiss joys,
or should I cry a little,
should I die or live for a while..
 
Still somewhere inside me,
there is a little life remaining..
 
(as if) the body burning down in the sun
got the shade of a tree,
like the smile of an angry kid
came back on a little cajoling..
something like that is what my heart is feeling now,
on the years old wounds, there is some balm applied
some such mercy is there in this moment,
where was this moment of mine..
now it's in front of me,
should I die or should I live a little..
should I kiss joys,
or should I cry a little,
should I die or live for a while..
 
like a kite with broken string
was this life of mine,
today I'm there, whether tomorrow takes place (for me) or not (is not known),
was my story everyday.. (he was unsure of how long he'd live)
now a new bond calls me from behind,
why does a worry for tomorrow trouble me,
such a prickle is there in this moment,
where was this moment of mine..
now it's in front of me,
should I die or should I live a little..
should I kiss joys,
or should I cry a little,
should I die or live for a while",2

Pirates sail and lost boys fly
Fish bite moonbeams every night

Superman's in pajamas on the couch
Goodnight moon we'll find the mouse

"Sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak
When you feel weak, you feel like you just wanna just give up
But you gotta search within you, try and find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of you, and get that motivation not to give up
And not be a quitter no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face.

Till I collapse Im spillin these
raps long as you feel em
Till the day that I drop youll never say that Im not killin em
Cuz when I am not, then Ima stop pinnin them and I am not
hip-hop and Im not just Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when Ima stop sendin
em, women are caught in webs, spin em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not
Get the illin to stop, amoxacillins just not real enough
The criminal cop killin hip-hop villiana
Minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
Your comin with me, feel it or not youre gonna fear it
Like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot lyrics to shock,
Is it a miracle
Or am I just a product of pop fizzin up?
Fa shizzel my wizzel, this is the plot
Listen up,
You bizzels forgot slizzel does not give a  fuck
Till the roof comes off,
Till the lights go out
Till my leg give out
Cant shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out
And my high burn out
Ima rip this shit till my bone collapse
Till the roof comes off
Till the lights go out
Till my legs give out
Cant shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out
Am I high, perhaps?
Ima rip this shit till my bone collapse

Music is like magic, theres a certain feelin
You get when youre real,
And you spit and people are feelin ya shit
This is your moment and every single minute
You spend trynna hold on to it
cuz you may never get it again
So while youre in it try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over
Just admit when its at its end
Cuz Im at the end of my wits with half the shit gets in
I got a list
Heres the order of my list that its in
It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie
Andre from Outkast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me
But in this industry, Im the cause of a lotta
Envy
So when Im not put on this list
The shit does not offend me
Thats why you see me walkin around like nothins
Botherin me, even though half
You people gotta fuckin problem with me
You hate it but you know respect you got to
Give me
The press wet dream like
Bobby and Whitney
Nate hit me
Till the roof comes off,
Till the lights go out
Till my leg give out
Cant shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out
And my high burn out
Ima rip this shit till my bone collapse
Till the roof comes off
Till the lights go out
Till my legs give out
Cant shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out
Am I high, perhaps
Ima rip this shit till my bone collapse

Soon as a verse starts I eat at an Emcee's
Heart, what is he thinkin', how
Not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my
Spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth
That would be the death of me first
'cuz in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could
Ever be worse that's why I'm
Clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like
I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack,
Like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full blown attack I'm launchin'
On them, the track is on some
Battlin' rap who wants some static
'Cuz I don't really think that the fact that
I'm Slim matters
A plague and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest so
Till the roof comes off,
Till the lights go out
Till my leg give out
Can't shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out
And my high burn out
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse
Till the roof comes off
Till the lights go out
Till my legs give out
Can't shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out
Am I high, perhaps?
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse

Until the roof, (Until the roof)
the roof comes off (The roof comes off)
Until my legs, (Until my legs)
give out from underneath me,
I, I will not fall,
I will stand tall
Feels like no one can
beat me

To an island where we'll meet

Though the breezes through trees
Move so pretty you're all I see
As the world keeps spinning round
You hold me right here right now

"Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end Always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened And that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger And that feels so rough
You didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records And then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
And I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know...

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened And that we were nothing

With branches growing from your mouth

You wear the moon like a halo

You wear the night like it's your coat

And you're always laughing

But you always look afraid

Hands against my eyes

I hear you crying in your sleep

I think we're haunted

No we're never alone

（And are trees falling through the windows）
I think we're haunted

And we're swimming through ghosts

Watching, what is it in your brain that never gets it?

Head that you'll never see of feel,
A consumer

The more the body is pierced, tortured, wounded, humiliated
The more complete his man's victory over pain,
The greater man victory over pain,
The greater his victory over the flesh.

That people are a plague
No sympathy
No liability
They drain my life

Black and blue

Cause I know that you never really loved me

And you never gave me signs Id see

That you and me were ever a possibility

After all the noise you left me lonely to die
And you never gave me a reason why
And now Im sittin all alone and I cry

Am I stupid
I shouldve known you were only playing a game
And you and me would never be the same

You made me feel like Im the one to blame
And I feel so stupid
After all those nights after nights that I tried
And all those conversations of lies
And Im sittin here all alone and Im cryin

Im crying....

All this love and baby no one else
Could ever love me the way that you do
Youre all I need and you treated me so wrong

Wait for the sign, To flick the switch of death
Its the beginning of the end
Sweat, chilling cold, As I watch death unfold
Consciousness my only friend
My fingers grip with fear
What I am doing here?

Now its time to die
Burning in my brain

Someone help me
Oh please God help me
They are trying to take it all away
I dont want to die

Time moving slowly, The minutes seem like hours
The final curtain call I see
How true is this?  Just get it over with
If this is true, just let it be
Wakened by the horrid cream
Freed from the frightening dream

Hesitate but don't refuse
The choice is yours but you said choose
The look she used was green and sharp
Stabbed that boy all in his heart
Come what may, the cosmos will
Take me up and down on Primirose Hill

Too many times I have seen
Autumn leaves turn to snow
Flowers wither to dust

They will suffer well

Cursed be the day
When they took her away and left me to bleed to death
Too many times since then
I have seen all beauty die
And the lakes turn to ice
But I swear
I will have my revenge

I wander between two worlds
No one can see me
They just feel my cold breath behind their backs
No redemption for the lost souls
I am doomed to walk the earth

But I swear
I will put them to eternal sleep
Then I can leave...",2

Of all these weird creatures who lock up their spirits
Drill holes in themselves and live for their secrets

They're all uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight

I wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane
Late at night when I'm driving
Take me on board their beautiful ship
Show me the world as I'd love to see it

I'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me
They'd think that I'd finally lost it completely
I'd show them the stars and the meaning of life
They'd shut me away

An offering so sweet
And they beckoned and they beckoned

Natives in a ring

The girls a-saying grace

And the air the viscous air
Pressed against my face
And it all got too damn much for me
Just got too damn rough
And I pushed away my plate
And said boys I’ve had enough
And I laid upon the table
Another piece of meat
And I opened up my veins to them

You might see me walking a dead rottweiler dog
with it's head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
hollerin at him cause the son of a bitch won't quit barkin
(grrrr, ARF ARF) Or leanin out a window, with a cocked shotgun
Drivin up the block in the car that they shot 'Pac in
Lookin for Big's killers, dressed in ridiculous
blue and red like I don't see what the big deal is
Double barrel twelve gauge bigger than Chris Wallace
Pissed off, cause Biggie and 'Pac just missed all this
Watchin all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em
and get dollars that shoulda been there's like they switched wallets
And amidst all this Crist' poppin and wristwatches
I had to sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
and walk around with an empty bottle of Remi Martin
startin shit like some 26-year-old skinny Cartman (""God damnit!"")
I'm anti-Backstreet and Ricky Martin
with instincts to kill N'Sync, don't get me started
These fuckin brats can't sing and Britney's garbage
What's this bitch retarded? Gimme back my sixteen dollars
All I see is sissies in magazines smiling
Whatever happened to whylin out and bein violent?
Whatever happened to catchin a good-ol' fashioned
passionate ass-whoopin and gettin your shoes coat and your hat tooken?

I think I was put here to annoy the world
and destroy your little 4-year-old boy or girl
Plus I was put here to put fear in faggots who spray Faygo Root Beer
and call themselves ""Clowns"" cause they look queer
Faggot2Dope and Silent Gay
Claimin Detroit, when y'all live twenty miles away (fuckin punks)
And I don't wrestle, I'll knock you fuckin faggots the fuck out
Ask 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out
after they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out
(AHHH!) Ducked down and got paintballs shot at they truck, blaow!
Look at y'all running your mouth again
when you ain't seen a fucking Mile Road, South of 10
And I don't need help, from D-12, to beat up two females
in make-up, who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails
""Slim Anus,"" you damn right, Slim Anus
I don't get fucked in mine like you two little flaming faggots!


Cause I'm, just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
I'm not a wrestler guy,
I'll knock you out if you talk about me (you talk about me)
Come and see me on the streets alone
if you assholes doubt me (assholes doubt me)
And if you wanna run your mouth
then come take your best shot at me (your best shot at me)


Is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me?
You little groupie bitch, get off me, go fuck Puffy
Now because of this blonde mop that's on top
and this fucked up head that I've got, I've gone pop?
The underground just spunned around and did a 360
Now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies
""Oh, he just did some shit with Missy,
so now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with MC Get-Bizzy""
My fuckin bitch mom's suin for ten million
She must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealin
Shit, where the fuck you think I picked up the habit?
All I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress
Which is it bitch, Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers?
 faggot!
Talkin about I fabricated my past
He's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass (Uhh!)
So tell me, what the hell is a fella to do?
For every million I make, another relative sues
Family fightin and fussin over who wants to invite me to supper
All the sudden, I got 90 some cousins (Hey it's me!)
A half-brother and sister who never seen me
or even bothered to call me until they saw me on TV
Now everybody's so happy and proud
I'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house
Hey-hey! And then to top it off, I walked to the newsstand
to buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp
Skipped to the last page, flipped right fast
and what do I see? A picture of my big white ass
Okay, let me give you motherfuckers some help:
uhh, here - DOUBLE XL, DOUBLE XL
Now your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell
Ahh fuck it, I'll even buy a couple myself

a little girl made a great big wish
to fill the world full of happiness
and be on santa's magic list

come on y'all
it's christmas time

shake it up

at the same time miles away
a little boy made a wish that day
that the world would be ok
and santa claus would hear him say:
i got dreams and i got love
i got my feet on the ground
and family above
can you send some happiness
with my best to the rest of the people
of the east and the west and
maybe every once in a while
give my grandma a reason to smile
tis the season of smile
it's cold but we'll be freezing in style
let me meet a girl one day
that wants to spread some love this way
we can let our souls run free and
she can open some happiness with me

shake it up
shake up the happiness
wake it up
wake up the happiness
come on y'all
it's christmas time

shake it up
shake up the happiness
wake it up
wake up the happiness
come on y'all
it's christmas time

i know you're out there
i hear your reindeer
i see the snow where
your boots have been
i'm gonna show them
so they will know then
their love will grow
when they believe again.

shake it up
shake up the happiness
wake it up
wake up the happiness
come on y'all
it's christmas time

"She's beautiful in her simple little way
She don't have too much to say when she gets mad
She understands she don't let go of anything
Even when the pain gets really bad
Guess I should've been more like that

You had it all for a pretty little while
And some how you made me smile when I was sad
You took a chance on a bruised and beaten heart
Then you realized you wanted what you had
I guess I should've been more like that
I should have held on to my pride
I should have never let you lie
I guess you got what you deserverd
I guess I should've been more like her
Forgiving you, she's stronger than I am
You don't look much like a man from where I'm at

You love her and she loves you with all she has

I must have been drinking,
I havent been dreaming about you for years.
There was a sharp turn and a sunburn
I was too cool for high school that year.
Must have have been new years, no one invited you,
You took things too far but i missed you
And your antics. you were lonesome and
Blue-eyed and so special to us.
You should have taken a long break
Instead of a long drop from a high place.
Ten years i never spoke your name.
Now it feels good to say it. your my friend again.
Said he forgave you, i said i hated you,
He was the bigger man, i was sixteen.
All the innosence it took well
I guess you finally made the year book. that year.
That year.
Instead of a long drop, instead of a leap of faith,
Ten years i never spoke your name,
Now it feels good to say it youre my friend again.

At least you can predict this every year
Love, you never know the minute it ends suddenly
I can't get it to speak
Maybe finding all the things it took to save us
I could fix the pain that bleeds inside of me

This question, is she needed?
And decide all the man I can ever be
Looking at the last 3 years like I did
I could never see us ending like this

Is a scene that's never ever happened to me

"Chains of despair cloacked by darkness
The thundering echoes of great destruction to come
Mankind's mysteries, the dying world

Madness in it's sweetest form, what shrivels and dies must face the tempest
The angelic heaven bows to the ultimate truth and melancholy grew

Anticipation mender through madness, condemned to the same horrid fate
Insanity applauds, how sharp the awakening
Pale as disease... mocking... maddening...
Give up the ghost, cease the gloomy awakening",3

"Sometimes because of jealousy and the intent to demise
Certain factions have to be forbidden or destroyed
Fire has to be sent to the poisoned forest
With the root of fresh trees planted elsewhere

Only then will you obtain a wilderness
That cannot be penetrated, petrified family tree

Got cut to a family tree with the limbs
And the leaves looking' at the world for answers

The answers in me, so I search through the darkness
Can't find the key so we locked in the land of the lost

Close my eyes, think what next on my rhymes
See this face in ink, I'm havin' visions of wisdom
Dreamin' 'bout my own ending

Am I seein' death as freedom and livin' as prison
My son didn't have a daddy to shape him so
God bless him with a daddy to save him
Yeah I raise him and pay some attention

He talked and he listened to reach him and teach him
Before I'm gone from existence
Teach him 'bout the foes, the hos and all opponents
Those that always talk 'bout love but never showed it

Those who had the chances to stand and always blowed it
Those that set you up by the hour to steal your moment
Pac the word is you ain't there so fuck the rumor
I'll get a pound of that shit from Bermuda

And meet you in Cuba
Fucked up on Larusa no doubt, I know the locale
If they gotta born you, I'm gonna mourne you till I join you

Who missed me from the heart, forever we're apart
Just because I'm nothin' and you abuse me and use me
Now you wanna try to come bruise me

And even though maybe were in there
Farther than it once was I know family don't always
Mean that they blood 'cause some people just
Don't give a nigga what some people tried to use my name

So all the fat we had to cut and I'm still
Walking with my six amp strut
Urban eyes see through camouflage
And now I know who's butt

So when I sent you tried to play me
All of a sudden now I'm shady
Maybe deep down in my heart
Never trust you from the start

Never hoped you'd be my homie, don't come 'round my way
And if we never speak again, it's got to be that way
This millennium, we'll be spankin' your heiny
Remind thee naughty invented family of the 90's

A time when a nickel cost a dollar
When you rise your chest dies

Ancient Egyptian scriptures fitted in through hyroglyphics
Motherfuckers try to touch my mental state
Niggas smile up in your face and then they infiltrate
So it seems nowadays that the only plan

To get my people help my people get a load of land
And I'm'ma see it if I have to kill some shit
To make my family tree a motherfucking wilderness
See a black man standin' on the promised land

Since they broke every promise I devised a plan this
Black this and black that crap is gettin' touchy
Any black hat that cross my path, I call him lucky

They gonna need us sweet Jesus

You better get rid of that nine, it ain't gonna help
What good's it gonna do against a man that strangles himself?

I'm waiting for hell like hell shit I'm anxious as Hell
Manson, you're safe in that cell, be thankful it's jail
I used to be my mommy's little angel at twelve
Thirteen I was putting shells in a gauge on a shelf

I used to get punked and bullied on my block
Till I cut a kitten's head off and stuck it in this kid's mailbox
{""Mom! MOM!""} I used to give a - fuck, now I could give a fuck less
What do I think of success?  It sucks, too much press I'm stressed

Too much cess and breasts, too upset
It's just too much mess, I guess I must just blew up quick (yes)
Grew up quick (no) was raised right
Whatever you say is wrong, whatever I say is right

You think of my name now whenever you say, ""Hi""
Became a commodity because I'm W-H-I-T-E 
'Cause MTV was so friendly to me can't wait 'til Kim sees me
Now is it worth it?  Look at my life, how is it perfect?
Read my lips bitch, what, my mouth isn't working?
You hear this finger?  Oh it's upside down
Here, let me turn this motherfucker up right now

That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm Back)
I'm Back (I'm back) I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm Back)
I'm Back (I'm back) I'm back

That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm Back)
I'm Back (I'm back) I'm back

I take each individual degenerate's head and reach into it
just to see if he's influenced by me if he listens to music
And if he feeds into this shit he's an innocent victim
and becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe

{*vocal scratches*} My name is Slim Shady
I been crazy way before radio didn't play me
The sensational {""Back is the incredible!""}
With Ken Kaniff, who just finds the men edible
It's Ken Kaniff on the internet
Trying to lure your kids with him into bed

It's a sick world we live in these days
""Slim for Pete's sakes put down Christopher Reeve's legs!""
Geez, you guys are so sensitive
""Slim it's a touchy subject, try and just don't mention it""

Mind with no sense in it, fried to get schizophrenic
whose eyes get so squinted, I'm blind from smoking 'em
With my windows tinted, with nine limos rented
Doing lines of coke in 'em with a bunch of guys hopping out
all high and indo scented {*inhales, exhales*}
And that's where I get my name from, that's why they call me

That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm Back)
I'm Back (I'm back) I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm Back)
I'm Back (I'm back) I'm back

I take seven kids from Columbine, stand 'em all in line
Add an AK-47, a revolver, a nine
A Mack-11 and it oughta solve the problem of mine
and that's a whole school of bullies shot up all at one time

Cause (I'mmmm) Shady, they call me as crazy
as the world was over this whole Y2K thing
And by the way, *NSYNC, why do they sing?
Am I the only one who realizes they stink?

Should I dye my hair pink and care what y'all think?
Lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings?
It's why I tend to block out when I hear things
Cause all these fans screaming is making my ears ring (AHHHH!!!)

So I just, throw up a middle finger and let it linger
longer than the rumor that I was sticking it to Christina
'Cause if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz
It'd be Jennifer Lopez and Puffy you know this!

I'm sorry Puff, but I don't give a fuck if this chick was my own mother
I still fuck her with no rubber and cum inside her
And have a son and a new brother at the same time
And just say that it ain't mine, what's my name?

That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm Back)
I'm Back (I'm back) I'm back
That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm Back)
I'm Back (I'm back) I'm back

That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm Back)

"The sunshine’s come,
the flowers dance along the river,
the mountain.
It’s cold in the stream,
I jump in and swim,
being a dreamer,
saying nothing in words.

Approaching to a child,
ignoring the crowd.
I hear my heart beats,
it’s so real.
Nameless song,
I’ve sung it over the way.
And maybe I’ll be alone
to be on the tramp with the moon.

So you empty the roads
leading the craft for truth.

Cause I don’t have wings to fly
so freely like birds in the sky.
I’ll have to let go of mind
to soar in the wind and smile.

Approaching to a child,
ignoring the crowd.
I hear my heart beats,
it’s so real.
Nameless song,
I’ve sung it over the way.

Thinking of you till it hurts

When today doesn't really know

If I called on you now
And said that I can't hold on
There's no easy way it gets harder each day

"When the world and I were young,
Just yesterday.

Life was such a simple game,
A child could play.

It was easy then to tell right from wrong.
Easy then to tell weak from strong.
When a man should stand and fight,
Or just go along.

But today there is no day or night
Today there is no dark or light.
Today there is no black or white,
Only shades of gray.
I remember when the answers seemed so clear

We had never lived with doubt or tasted fear.
It was easy then to tell truth from lies
Selling out from compromise
Who to love and who to hate,

The foolish from the wise.

But today there is no day or night
Today there is no dark or light.
Today there is no black or white,
Only shades of gray.


It was easy then to know what was fair
When to keep and when to share.
How much to protect your heart
And how much to care.
But today there is no day or night
Today there is no dark or light.
Today there is no black or white,
Only shades of gray.
Only shades of gray.

Yo, the saga begins, beget war
I draw first blood be the first to set it off
My cause, tap all jaws lay down laws
We takin' what's yours we do jerks rush the doors
Here come the deez tryin' to make breeze and guns toss
In full force, my team'll go at your main source
We're not tourists, hit bosses and take hostage
Your whole setup, from the ground up we lock shit
Blood flood your eye, fuck up your optics
Switch to killer instincts for niggaz pop shit
Yo nigga Noyd what's the topic? Nine pound we rocked in
Ninety-six strike back with more hot shit
Illuminate my team'll glow like, radiation
With no time for patient, or complication
Let's get it done right, my click airtight
Trapped in a never ending gunfight so niggaz lose stripes
Or lose life, jail niggaz sendin kites to the street
Over some beef that wasn't fully cooked, finish 'em off
Well done meat, that said twenty-two slug to your head
Travel all the way down to your leg

Chorus: together

Aiyyo it's hell on earth, whose next or gonna be first
The projects is front lines, and the enemy is one time
I ain't gotta tell you
It's right in front of your eyes

Milli stacked down, heavenly guarded by hollow tip slug
Then crack down, on wannabe thugs adapt to gat sound
And bow down, slow the fuck up, see how my foul now
Articulate, hittin body parts to start shiftin shit
Never hesitant, it's the crack game unlimited
Summon rasta we can do this, forever infinite
Then reminesce, twenty years later how we was gettin' it
Either with me go against the grain you better hit me
Leggin me or robbin me niggaz better body me
'Cause it's a small world and niggaz, talkin' like bitches
Bitches singin' like snitches, pointin you out in pictures
'Cause she rep the QBC faithfully, playa hatin' me
All that bullshit, is just makin' me
More the better, then concentrate on gettin' chedda
If shorty set you up you better dead her, I told you
Shape and mold you, Sun you, then I hold you
Like a pimp mind control you double edge blow you
It'll be I, like I'm supposed to, the click is coastal
International to local, Bacardi mix physically fix
Hit you with shit, that'll leave a loose nigga stiff
Probably thick, Son I solved em
Pulled him in my world then evolved him to chaos

Yo, the heavy metal king hold big shit, with spare clips
You seein clips when the mac spit your top got split
Layin dead with open eyes close his eyelids
Turn off his lights switch to darkness, cause deep in the abyss

Youse the wild child, kid cold turnin' men into mice
I was born to take power leave my mark on this planet
The Phantom of Crime Rap, niggaz is left stranded
Shut down your operation, closed for business
Leave a foul taste in your mouth, like Guinness
POW niggaz is found MIA
We move like the special forces, green beret
Heavily around my throat, I don't play
Shit brand new, back in eighty-nine, the same way

To simplify shit, no man can go against me
Test me you must be bent G, don't tempt me
I had this full clip for so long, it needs to empty
The reason why it full for so long, 'cause I don't waste shit
You probably hid, blood in your mouth, so you could taste it
Quiet as kept, I lay back and watch the world spin
I hear thugs, claimin that they gonna rob the Mobb
When they see us, I tell you what black, here's the issue
It's a package deal, you rob me, you take this message
Along with that, I ain't your average cat
Fuck rap, I'm tryin' to make CREAM and that's that
Whatever it takes however it gots to go down
Four mikes on stage a motherfuckin four pound
Speakers leakin out sound and niggaz leakin on the ground
I could truly care less the God will get his
Regardless blow for blow let's find out who wear hardest
This rap artist used to be a stickup artist
Sometimes I test myself see if I still got it

Regard shit or forget the essence, from which I emerged

Melody instead of Lost In Your Eyes?

where I can feel safe

This is the first time I have loved someone so much.
 
Let love pour down, the rainy season is here,
The season for you and I to meet is here,
Why can't I bear even a moment's separation,
Why is it that, every morning, you are not in my breath,
Come to me, I'll love you so much,
I've spent so many nights waiting for you,
How can I express these feelings to you,
I have loved you even more than myself.
 
Leave everything and come, the rainy season is here,
The season for you and I to meet is here,
I will hold you to my chest, hidden from everyone,
I will cross all limits, immersed in your love,
This is the first time I have loved someone so much.
 
Your wet lips are telling me something,
My heart is happy that our thoughts are the same,
Don't stop yourself now, listen to your heart,
Let the evening turn into night,
This moment is so beautiful,
I have stolen it from destiny.
 
Don't leave tonight, the rainy season is here,
The season for you and I to meet is here,
I will hold you to my chest, hidden from everyone,
I will cross all limits, immersed in your love,
This is the first time I have loved someone so much.",1
"Strange Woman

Strange Bed

Thor's hammer pounding in my head

Six straight double shots of high-grade single malt
And my mouth is tasting dryer than table salt

Yeah, but I know what I'm doing

I'm on the road to ruin

Monday morning
Last Friday night

Well I had the feeling everything was alright

Here I am in trouble with the love of my life

Hoping she don't cut me with no butcher knife

I got brownie points a-cruing

I'm on the road to ruin

Sun blinding

Teeth grinding

Ears burning

Stomach turning
Well, Summer's comming and the winter's gone

Here I am still sleeping with my blue jeans on

Well I had it going till I lost my job

Now I'm out here casing out some joint to rob

Baby's needing shooing

I'm on the road to ruin

Sirens blaring

Neighbors staring

Judge's gavel

Well, I come unraveled
Well, I've been rolling downhill since I was ten

My Les Paul livin's going to do me in

I can't get this roller-coaster rifle to a stop
Cause when I hit the bottom I'm right back on top

Big ideas a brewing

Well I'm on the road to ruin

"Dear, I fear wer're facing a problem
You love me no longer, I know
And maybe there is nothing
That I can do to make you do
Mama tells me I shouldn't bother
That I ought to stick to another man
A man that surely deserves me
But I think you do

So I cry, I pray and I beg

Love me love me
Say that you love me
Fool me fool me
Go on and fool me
Love me love me
Pretend that you love me
Leave me leave me
Just say that you need me
So I cry, and I pray for you too
Love me love me
Say that you love me
Leave me leave me
Just say that you need me
I can't care 'bout anything but you...

Lately I have desperately pondered,
Spent my nights awake and I wonder
What I could do have done in another way
To make you stay
Reason will not lead to solution
I will end up lost in confusion
I don't care if you really care
As long as you don't go

So I cry, I pray and I beg

Love me love me
Say that you love me
Fool me fool me
Go on and fool me
Love me love me
Pretend that you love me
Leave me leave me
Just say that you need me

So I cry, and I pray for you too

When it gets too cold
You're not alone

Screaming on the phone over something that he did
And I wonder what can I do
To make you phone loud so you can let me in

"Follow You Down to the Red Oak Tree - James Vincent McMorrow
Follow you down to the red oak tree

As the air moves thick through the hollow reeds

Will you wait for me there until someone comes

To carry me, carry me down

See I have not, I have not grown cold

I have stole from men who have stole from those

With their arms so thin and their skin so old

But you are young, you are young, you are young

Then somebody laughs like it's all just for hell

As though we could not be saved
from the depth of the well

But the cloth that I make is a cloth you can sell

To pay for the gossamer seeds

Names get carved in the red oak tree

Of the ones who stay and the ones who leave

I will wait for you there with these cindered bones

So follow me, follow me down

Follow me, follow me down

Follow me, follow me down

Follow me, follow me down

"Deep inside these burning buildings
Voices die to be heard
Years we spent teaching a lesson
We ourselves had never learned

And if strength is born from heartbreak
Then mountains I could move
And if walls could speak I'd pray
That they would tell me what to do

If you see me, please just walk on by, walk on by
Forget my name and I'll forget it too 
(Simple lives...) failed attempts at living simple lives, simple lives
Always keep me coming back to you

No signs of life here, save the embers, the occasional flame
We'd know the way but can't remember, conception to the grave
Shout confessions from the greatest heights, where no one can hear
All my fears, my insecurities are falling like tears

If you see me, please just walk on by, walk on by
Forget my name and I'll forget it too
(Simple lives...) failed attempts at living simple lives, simple lives
Always keep me coming back to you.

The drones will slave away, they're working overtime
They serve a faceless queen, they never question why
(I won't come back!) disciples of a God, they neither live nor breathe
(I won't come back!) but we have bills to pay, yeah we have mouths to feed!
I won't come back!

And if you see me, please just walk on by, walk on by
Forget my name and I'll forget it too
(Simple lives...) failed attempts at living simple lives, simple lives
Always keep me coming back to you

I'm coming back to you!",4

What lover gets out of this is just sorrows
Not everyone can explore this treasure

Beyond those talks, beyond those promises,
Just try to look beyond for once
It's like a flame, like fire

I sold my songs to have my fortune told
And it said you should know that love will never die
But see how it kills you in the blink of an eye

I know of love as a hot white light
That knocks you down and then leaves you to dry
Oh, how can it be sweet momma tell me why
Why all love's disciples have to wither and die

Please sister help me come on do what you should
Please give me something I'm not doing so good
I'm gone down wrong is there nothing you can say
Please sister help me I'm not feeling ok

Give me belief that my time will come
And a toll free helpline if I find someone
But she said you gave away what you never really had
And now your purse is empty I can see why you're sad.

Oh Please sister help me come on do what you should
Please give me something I'm not doing so good
I'm gone down wrong is there nothing you can say
Please sister help me can you make me feel ok

So if it's true that love will never die
Then why do the lovers work so hard to stay alive

Please
Oh please sister help me
Please give me something
Oh please sister you know I do what I can
Oh sweet momma please just send me a man

Just a little love to live

And a little love to sail in

And the kids on the corner playing ghetto games

And when I looked into your eyes I knew it was true

But I know one thing
That I love you

bump into person in the middle of the road

Oh, oh, oh, really go wild-yeah, doin’ it in style
Oh, oh, oh, get in the action-feel the attraction
Color my hair-do what I dare
Oh, oh, oh, I wanna be free-yeah, to feel the way I feel
Man! I feel like a woman!

Oh yeah
The best thing about being a woman
Is the prerogative to have a little fun fun fun...
Oh, oh, oh, go totally crazy-forget I’m a lady
Men’s shirts-short skirts

Man! I feel like a woman!

I get totally crazy
Can you feel it
Come, come, come on baby
I feel like a woman

"Wendy left me all alone
No postcard or telephone
Wintertime down by the beach
In a jukebox bar way out of reach

She liked Tom Waits and the poet's hat
Sixties Kinks and Kerouac
Through the night her tailights fade
Her selection never played

I don't know I don't know I don't know why
Checkin' the tears and the light in your eyes
I don't know I don't know I don't know
If my little baby will make it alone

Wendy took me with a smile
Country lips and Bacall style
Through Tangiers or to Bombay
Her self-portrait in the USA
I don't know I don't know I don't know why
Checkin' the tears and the light in your eyes
I don't know I don't know I don't know
If my little baby will make it alone

Dreams 
Dyin' slowly
We don't want to be alone
Dreams
Dark and holy
We don't want to be alone

Thinking the things that I can't erase
Hole in my heart and a gun in my face
Feeling the things that I can't describe
I don't know I don't know I don't know why

Dreams 
Dyin' slowly
We don't want to be alone
Dreams
Dark and holy
We don't want to be alone

Let down
Wendy
Get down
I don't know I don't know I don't know why",1
"The atom will implode
The fragile kingdom fold
The tremor becomes a quake
And there's a body in the lake

And as the two of us rebel
Damn you all to hell
I wonder is this all there is

Time will help you through
But it doesn't have the time
To give you all the answers to the never-ending why

The sound of silence grows
As a spiders' kisses lay
The tumour becomes malign
But the kids are doing fine

And as the two of us rebel
And damn you all to hell
I wonder is this all there is

Time will help you through
But it doesn't have the time
To give you all the answers to the never-ending why",1
"I'm feeling mean today
Not lost, not thrown away
Just irritated and quite hated
Self control breaks down

Why's everything so tame?
I like my life insane
I'm barricading and debating
Who I'm gonna kick around

Right now, can't find a way to get across the hate when I see you
Right now, I feel it scratch inside, I wanna slash and beat you
Right now, I rip apart the things inside that excite you
Right now, I can't control myself, I fucking hate you

I'm feeling cold today
Not hurt, just fucked away
I'm devastated and frustrated
God I feel so bound

So when I feel the need
I think it's time to bleed
I'm gonna cut myself
A watch the blood
Hit the ground

Right now, can't find a way to get across the hate when I see you
Right now, I feel it scratch inside, I wanna slash and beat you
Right now, I rip apart the things inside that excite you
Right now, I can't control myself, I fucking hate you

You open your mouth again
I swear I'm gonna break it
You open your mouth again
My God I cannot take it

Shut up, shut up, shut up, I'll fuck you up
Shut up, shut up, shut up, I'll fuck you up
Shut up, shut up, shut up, I'll fuck you up
Shut up, shut up, shut up, I'll fuck you up

My heart won't deny U
So many seem so lonely.
With no one left 2 cry 2 baby

"The room filled up with water
And the roar of the crowd died down
They didn't hold their breath
They just waited to drown

Now, I'm the ghost in the corner
That nobody knows
I'm just a chill in the air that comes
And cuts you to the bone

I've never seen it shine so bright before
I stumble blind into the light of it all

The walls of this city are
All cold metal and stone
But we're nothing permanent:
We're just soft skin and bones

I'm just the pins and the
Needles attacking your toes
I'm just a message saved
In your phone a long, long time ago
Where I'm singing how...

I've never seen it shine so bright before
I stumbled blind into the light, the light of it all
You've never seen it shine so hard before—
You'd crumble underneath the weight, the weight of it all

I'm always with you
I never left you alone",2

But for now I'll just say I love you
Nothing more seems important somehow
And tomorrow can wait come whatever
Let me love you forever but right now
Right now

Some fine day when we go walking
We‘ll take time for idle talking
Sharing every feeling as we
watch each other smile

I'll hold your hand you'll hold my hand
We'll say things we never had planned
Then we'll get to know each other
in a little while

But for now let me say I love you
Later on there'll be time for so much more
But for now meaning now and forever
Let me kiss you my darling then once more
Once more

But for now let me say I love you
Later on I must know much more of you
But for now here and now how I love you
As you are in my arms I love you
I love you

"In New York freedom looks like
Too many choices
In New York I found a friend
To drown out the other voices

Voices on the cell phone
Voices from home
Voices of the hard sell
Voices down the stairwell
In New York, just got a place in New York

In New York summers get hot
Well into the hundreds
You can't walk around the block
Without a change of clothing

Hot as a hairdryer in your face
Hot as a handbag and a can of mace
New York, I just got a place in New York
New York, New York

In New York you can forget
Forget how to sit still
Tell yourself you will stay in
But it's down to Alphaville

New York, New York, New York
New York, New York, New York

The Irish have been coming here for years
Feel like they own the place
They got the airport, city hall, concrete, asphalt
They even got the police

Irish, Italian, Jews and Hispanics
Religious nuts, political fanatics in the stew
Living happily not like me and you
That's where I lost you New York

New York, New York
New York, New York

In New York I lost it all
To you and your vices
Still I'm staying on to figure out
My midlife crisis

I hit an iceberg in my life
But you know I'm still afloat
You lose your balance, lose your wife
In the queue for the lifeboat

You got to put the women and children first
But you've got an unquenchable thirst for New York

New York, New York
New York, New York

In the stillness of the evening
When the sun has had its day
I heard your voice whispering
""Come away, child""

New York, New York",4
"There's a sword in your side,
That you'll ignore until blood shows,
And later on, when it's gone,
When something's wrong,
The violence grows and it's designed,
To spy and try to poke your eyes,
While laying low.

Beneath the seven different reasons for satellites,
Eleven different reasons for fists in fights,
There's never been a reason for
Shouting when it's quiet,
But no one's ever listening.

Through the mud and the rain,

All that's left is hesitations
From your previous life.

"Last night I heard my own heart beating
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reaching
Even though I know you're not here
I was playing back a thousand memories baby
Thinking 'bout everything we've been through
Maybe I've been going back too much lately
Time stood still and I had you

Come back come back come back to me like
You would you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out

Come back come back come back to me
Like you could you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Locked up in your arms and our friends are laughing
Cos nothing like this ever happened to them
Now I'm pacing down the hall chasing down the street
Flashback to a night when you said to me
Nothings gonna change not for me and you
Not before I knew how much I had to lose...

Come back come back come back to me like
You would you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside til I came out

Come back come back come back to me
Like you could you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

If you you're out there, if you're somewhere, if you're moving on
I've been waiting for you wary since you've been gone
I just want it back the way it was before
And I just want to see you back at my front door
And I say
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, before you said it's not that easy
Before the fight, before I left you out
But I take it all back now

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside til I came out

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here right now

You'd be here right now
It's not the kind of ending you want to see now
Figure out a better ending
Ohhh oh
I thought you'd be here right now
Whoa oh

Then I saw you I didn't know what to say
You're eyes were shining
You're smile was so kind

Or maybe I don't have eyes like the sky

And you said we are meant to be
I was happy, everything was so nice
But then I found out that everything was a lie

Or maybe I don't have eyes like the sky
And I'm not sure if I'm the girl in your dreams

You showed me how to cry

(That's all there ever is) Oh yeah yeah yeah?
(That's all there ever was) Ah you must be fucking joking.
(The same for everyone) Oh yes. Yes yes.
Would you repeat that. Break it to me gently,
Stand over there.
Oh I know I was an arrogant boy but I let you hold the door
Oh I was kind. I was nice, where's the prize?
And I'm on the train from New Street
To Euston. I'm going out to Harrow again
And I'm trying to get the feeling
That I had in nineteen seventy two.
Oh but you're going too fast for me here,
I'm saying, wait a minute there, wait a minute there
Hold it, stop! Let me get this clear
(That's all there ever is) oh yeah yeah yeah?
(That's all there ever was) yes, yes. ha ha ha.
(The same for everyone) Oh yes. yes. yes.
You see I know what this is, I know
What's going on here, this is just the difference between ...
It's the battle between the body and the soul. The spirit
And what's needed here...
What I intend to do now is I'm going to punish my body.
I'll punish the body to believe in the soul, I will punish
My body, until I believe in my soul.",3
"Small talking and nothing to do
You keep it locked in a shopping cart
A bourgeois shangri-La

Got a feeling that I don't belong
Got a feeling that I shouldn't be here
Can't stand another single day

Ohhh….

Talking shit about the neighbor's wife
But when she comes you put on a big smile
Like to throw up in a Gucci bag
Shes coming here to brag

Got a feeling that I don't belong
Got a feeling that I shouldn't be here
Can't stand another single day
Gotta get away

A house and a boat and a great shiny car
Things just to prove you'll go far
Soda streamer, widescreen TV, cute little dog
Perfect in your shallow bourgeois

For just us to know

Fresh on the pavement I ran off the plane
That July 9th the beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms

Wearing your clothes

Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

I do remember the swing in your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I roll my eyes and then you pull me in
I'm not much for dancing but for you I did
Because I love your handshake
Me and my father
I love how you walk with
your hands in your pockets
How you kissed me when I was
In the middle of saying something
There's not a day when I don't miss those rude interruptions
But now I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is that
I don't know how to be something you miss

Never imagined we'd end like this

And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are

And I hope the sun shines
And it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you
You wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in weather and town
But I never planned on you changing your mind

Wearing your clothes

Walking down by the bay, on the shore,
staring up at the planes that aren't there anymore
I was feeling the night grow old and you were looking so cold
Like an introvert, I drew my over shirt
Around my arms and began to shiver violently before
You happened to look and see the tunnels all around me
Running into the dark underground
All the subways around create a great sound
To my motion fatigue: farewell
With your ear to a seashell
You can hear the waves in underwater caves
As if you actually were inside a saltwater room

Time together is just never quite enough
When you and I are alone, I've never felt so at home
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?
We need time, only time
Can you believe that the crew has gone
and wouldn't let me sign on?
All my islands have sunk in the deep,
so I can hardly relax or even oversleep
I feel as if I were home some nights
when we count all the ship lights
I guess I'll never know why sparrows love the snow
We'll turn off all of the lights and set this ballroom aglow

So tell me darling, do you wish we’d fall in love?
Time together is just never quite enough
When you and I are alone, I’ve never felt so at home
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?
We need time, only time
When we’re apart whatever are you thinking of?
If this is what I call home, why does it feel so alone?
So tell me darling, do you wish we’d fall in love?
All the time, all the time

Time together is just never quite enough
When we’re apart whatever are you thinking of?
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?
So tell me darling, do you wish we’d fall in love?
All the time

"This broken wheel is coming undone
And the road's exploding
But you're keeping me strong
Rolling along with you

Love is a tower
And you're the key
Leading me higher
When you let me in

Keeping us close, so close
On down the line
Sometimes I burn like a dot on the sun
With no one knowing
But you're keeping me strong
Moving along with you

You are a tower of
Strength to me
The darkening hour
Sees light again

Ooh wah, ooh wah, ooh wah, ooh wah, ooh wah
You are, you are, you are, you are

Love is a tower
Of strength to me
I am the shoreline
But you're the sea

You are
You are

Watch the sun rise from the tropic isle
Just remember darling all the while
You belong to me
See the market place in old Algiers
Send me photographs and souvenirs
Just remember when a dream appears
You belong to me

And I'll be so alone without you
Maybe you'll be lonesome too
Fly the ocean in a silver plane
See the jungle when it's wet with rain
Just remember till you're home again
You belong to me

Oh I'll be so alone without you
Maybe you'll be lonesome too
Fly the ocean in a silver plane

"Your fingertips across my skin
The palm trees swaying in the wind
Images

You sang me Spanish lullabies
The sweetest sadness in your eyes
Clever trick

Well, I never want to see you unhappy
I thought you want the same for me
Goodbye, my almost lover
Goodbye, my hopeless dream
I'm trying not to think about you
Can't you just let me be?
So long, my luckless romance
My back is turned on you
Should've known you'd bring me heartache
Almost lovers always do

We walked along a crowded street
You took my hand and danced with me

And when you left, you kissed my lips
You told me you would never, never forget
These images
No

Almost lovers always do

I cannot go to the ocean
I cannot drive the streets at night
I cannot wake up in the morning
Without you on my mind
So you're gone and I'm haunted
And I bet you are just fine
Did I make it that
Easy to walk right in and out
Of my life?
Goodbye, my almost lover
Goodbye, my hopeless dream

"For 27 years I've been trying to believe
and confide in different people I've found.

Some of them got closer than others
Some wouldn't even bother
and then you came around

I didn't really know what to call you,
you didn't know me at all
But I was happy to explain.

I never really knew how to move you
So I tried to intrude through
the little holes in your vanes
And I saw you
But that's not an invitation
That's all I get
If this is communication
I disconnect
I've seen you, I know you
But I don't know
How to connect, so I disconnect

You always seem to know where to find me
and I'm still here behind you
In the corner of your eye.

I'll never really learn how to love you
But I know that I love you
through the hole in the sky.
Where I see you
And that's not an invitation
That's all I get
If this is communication
I disconnect
I've seen you, I know you
But I don't know
How to connect, so I disconnect

Well this is an invitation
It's not a thread
If you want communication
That's what you get
I'm talking and talking
But I don't know
How to connect
And I hold a record for being patient
With your kind of hesitation

I need you, you want me

How to connect, so I disconnect

And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve

and they blame it on Marilyn (on Marilyn).. and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper class ci-ty
havin this happenin (this happenin)..
then attack Eminem cause I rap this way (rap this way)..

And pigeon-holed into some pop-py sensation
to cop me rotation at rock'n'roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (got the patience)..
to deal with these cocky caucasians who think
I'm some wigger who just tries to be black cause I talk
with an accent, and grab on my balls, so they always keep askin
the same fuckin questions (fuckin questions)..
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who what when, the where, and the how

"I've hardly been outside my room in days,
'Cause I don't feel that I deserve the sunshine's rays.
The darkness helped until the whiskey wore away,
And it was then I realized that conscience never fades.
When you're young you have this image of your life:
That you'll be scrupulous and one day even make a wife.
And you make boundaries you'd never dream to cross,
And if you happen to you wake completely lost.
But I will fight for you, be sure that
I will fight until we're the special two once again.

And we will only need each other, we'll bleed together,
Our hands will not be taught to hold another's,
'Cause we're the special two.
And we could only see each other, we'll breathe together,
These arms will not be taught to need another's,
'Cause we're the special two.

I remember someone old once said to me:
That lies will lock you up with truth the only key
But I was comfortable and warm inside my shell,
And couldn't see this place could soon become my hell.
So is it better to tell and hurt or lie to save their face?
Well I guess the answer is don't do it in the first place.
I know I'm not deserving of your trust from you right now,
But if by chance you change your mind you know I will not
Let you down 'cause we were the special two, and will be again.

And we will only need each other, we'll bleed together,
Our hands would not be taught to hold another's,
'Cause we're the special two.
And we could only see each other we'll breathe together,
These arms will not be taught to need another's
'Cause we're the special two.

I step outside my mind's eyes for a minute.
And I look over me like a doctor looking for disease,
Or something that could ease the pain.
But nothing cures the hurt you bring on by yourself,
Just remembering, just remembering how we were

And we would only need each other, we'd bleed together,
These hands would not be taught to hold another's,
We were the special two.
And we could only see each other we'd bleed together,
These arms would not be taught to need another's

In her early years she had to learn
How to grow up living in a war that she called home
Never know just where to turn for shelter from the storm

Everytime my father's fist would put her in her place
Hearing all the yelling I would cry up in my room
Hoping it would be over soon

Bruises fade father, but the pain remains the same

Strength is my mother for all the love she gave
Every morning that I wake I look back to yesterday
And I'm OK

When it's you that helped me put up all these walls I've built
Shadows stir at night through a crack in the door
The echo of a broken child screaming ""please no more""
Daddy, don't you understand the damage you have done
To you it's just a memory, but for me it still lives on

Troubles win in this town,
Troubles don't turn upside-down,
ohh - they shit on the last bit of fun
There's sin all around,
Lovers cannot let down,
and the winter wears and tears
our bones.
There's a man in this town
is shooting us down, he
thinks he's a big man but he doesnt know anything about us or anything at all.
At night he lies awake,
and his heart aches,
cos its cold - ohh ohh old,
he sweats it out all the night through,
and he throws up all over me and you.
ohh ohhh, i wanna catch my difficult
ohhh ohhh, cos i'm scared of growin old
ohh oh ohh, don't return the love i gave you
ohhh oh oh, your still my favourite
ohh ohhh, i wanna catch my difficult
ohhh ohhh, cos i'm scared of growin old
ohh oh ohh, don't return the love i gave you
ohhh oh oh, your still my favourite
Air-conditioning's cold,
summers hot and love is old
i wish i was even smaller,
a little creepy crawler

"My nane is trouble
My first name's a mess
No need to greet me
I'm here to confess
That if you let me hold you
I won't hold my breath
And if you let me love you
I will love till death

My chase is endless
I tend to obsess
No game lives up to
My need to possess
But if you let me hold you
I won't hold my breath
And if you let me love you
I will love till death

I'm petrified of emptiness
And let aside the loneliness
The lovers tend to break me in two
If you were to come back to me
In pieces or in melody
There couldn't be a better way through...

My name is trouble
My first name's a mess
Born to deceive you
Brought up to redress
And if you let me hold you
I won't hold my breath
But if you make me need you
I will need you less

And let aside the loneliness
The lovers tend to break me in two
If you were to come back to me
In pieces or in melody
There couldn't be a better way through...

My first name's a mess
No need to greet me

"As a tear fades away
And the dawn dries a lover's eyes
No more tears, they're all gone
Just believe it will always be

My heart in your hand
Knows that all this belongs to me
And like the child here I stay
While your heart sings inside of me

One dream of my live
One night in eternity
The wind whispered soft to me
And heaven stood still

One sigh of the dawn
Sweet instant of memory
One celestial rhapsody
And heaven stood still",2

Go out the way I came in
So innocent, so pure with no thoughts of insecurity
Live life to the fullest be what I wanna be

Last day on earth I tell my mama don't cry
I'll see my daddy in paradise
Where the blind can see, the mute can talk, the crippled can walk
But for now Heaven's in New York

First thing I'd do is go back in time
Take the twin towers, put it back in the skyline
Tell my girl two wrongs still don't make a right
Make love for the last time under the candlelight

Pick up my homies at the gentleman club
After that hit the club and reminisce about the High School Days
Man I sucked as a quarterback remember getting sacked man
Almost broke my back, yeah

If it was my last day on earth, treat it like my first
Go out the way I came in
So innocent, so pure with no thoughts of insecurity

Kids stop shootin' I cant sing in no more ways
I cant take the money with me so I caught a movie
Favorite actress Angelina Jolie

Favorite singer got to be Marley
Turn up the bass and move to his stylings
Cant leave without reading my daughter a bedtime story
The heavens is calling

If it was my last day on earth, treat it like my first
Go out the way I came in
So innocent so pure with no thoughts of insecurity
Live life to the fullest, be what I wanna be

Last day on earth I tell my homies don't cry

Heavens in New York
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Even though I walk through the Valley of Shadow of Death
I fear no evil for you are with me
Tell my loved ones please don't cry
'Cause if doves can fly so can I

If it was my last day on earth, treat it like my first
Go out the way I came in
So innocent so pure with no thoughts of insecurity
Live life to the fullest, be what I wanna be

"Here comes a cold
Break out the winter clothes
And find a love to call your own
You - enter you
Your cheeks a shade of pink
And the rest of you in powder blue

Who knows what will be
But I'll make you this guarantee

See
No way November will see our goodbye
When it comes to December it's obvious why
No one wants to be alone at Christmas time

In the dark, on the phone
You tell me the names of your brothers
And your favorite colors
I'm learning you
And when it snows again
We'll take a walk outside
And search the sky
Like children do

I'll say to you
No way November will see our goodbye
When it comes to December it's obvious why
No one wants to be alone at Christmas time

And come January we're frozen inside
Making new resolutions a hundred times
February, won't you be my valentine?
And we'll both be safe 'til St. Patrick's Day

We should take a ride tonight around the town
And look around at all the beautiful houses
Something in the way that blue lights
On the black night can make you feel more
Everybody, it seems to me, just wants to be
Just like you and me

No one wants to be alone at Christmas time
Come January we're frozen inside
Making new resolutions a hundred times
February, won't you be my valentine?

And if our always is all that we gave
And we someday take that away
I'll be alright if it was just 'til
St. Patrick's Day",2

"Buy now, I kill for a living
Buy now, I kill for a living...

I'm fitted for a heat-resistant sleeve
Keep your distance please
Your persona's in question my phosphorescent skin
Makes your heat pistons freeze
I'm a hallucinogen pez-dispenser, led ventures
With a group of umpla-lumpa parachute troopers
Who discredit theories and behead your mentors
Who can radio wave windsurf to invert what is common knowledge
I will insert my solemn promise to style until my limbs burst
Negotiate with marketing consultants, giving me the once-over
Wearing grim smirks
They would like me to convert my gritty edge
To unearth my earning potential
But my face is so sun burnt
Due to all the grassroots grunt work
That I won't be co-opted
And every photo-op needs to be photoshopped cropped and snipped
But I'm a street vendor kinds sir
This style-free is dopamine
It's a meat tenderizer at the gallery opening

You can join my suicide cult
Membership is free
Take these cyanide eye-drops
And peppermint hemlock
This is what you have been billed for
Dancing on the kill floor
To vibrant woofer, clients butchered to a film score
This is what you have been killed for
Dancing on the kill floor
To vibrant woofer, clients butchered to a film score

Contrast bohemia to my workplace
When I'm racing in carpool lane
To sell shit to an art school lame
-Don't you think you're hot shit
Well what do you have to offer-
A dead archetype able to be purchased on a credit card swipe
But they can they pinpoint and nail
My distance between art and commerce
With just an invoice of a sale
I will disappoint an ail
Those who want to deny us the majority rule
When a will jump in my primordial pool
Without knowing where their swim trunks were
But not everyone knows
What they're called on to encumber
You can't know by just logging on with a pin number
Buy now
You pasty Brits
Buy now
You crazy chicks
Buy
'Cause I don't pay attention to rules,
Regulations or safety tips
Love us
Eligible bachelors
Love us
'Cause we're the Blowed rappers
Loved
'Cause I tour the country so much
I can do it blindfolded with no road atlas
Unrelated to your three-legged
Preachy bootleggers will do away with you
CD duplicators make vegans
Do the salad bar swing-pivot
Wave your valid parking tickets
At the endangered sea-urchin
Tell me the name of your political activist key person
And I'll tell you what's under the blips of the clean version
Of the infamous rap rant
Trickling down the baggy pant leg
Of this unhappy class aid
Covered in shell fragments of this
Graffiti tagged glass egg
I can sell anything to a hip-hopper
Like it's my cathartic something
But I don't make enough to go apartment hunting

You can dance to death
And for no extra charge
Give me your debit card
So you can have sex with stars
This is what you have been billed for
Dancing on the kill floor
To vibrant woofer, clients butchered to a film score

You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then

When everything out of reach someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you

She's a rock 'n' roll survivor with pendulum hips
She's got deep brown eyes that've seen it all

Working at a nightclub that was called The Avenue
The bar men used to call her ""Little Lisa, Looney Tunes""
She went down on almost anyone

From the hard time living 'til the Chelsea days
From when her hair was sweet blonde 'til the day it turned gray
She said, ""L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N.

And Joey was an artist just living out of case
But his best work was his letters home

Extended works of fiction about imaginary success
The chorus girls in neon were his closest things to friends
But to a writer, the truth is no big deal

From the hard time living to the sleepless nights
And the black and blue body from the weekend fights
He'd say, ""L.I.F.E.G.O.E.S.O.N.

And the psalms will never call me again

"You're the infection my friend
Disgusting right to the end
Didn't I know it then?
I knew it, I knew it
You're basic, but hard to define
Simple yet somehow sublime
Knew you would strike again
I knew it, I knew it
You're all that's wrong
With your dumbass song
Yet that's all that you will ever be
Nothing you can do 'cause
That's all that you will ever be
Polished, you shimmer when shined
But rotten and seething inside
Everyone falls for this
I knew it, I knew it
You're all that's wrong
With your dumbass song
Yet that's all that you will ever be
Nothing you can do 'cause
That's all that you will
That's all that you will
That's all that you will ever be

Ever be, never be, want to be god
All to be, made to be, holding the son
Throwing it, breaking it, over your grave
Sending you back to the place you once came
It must be hard to be you
Nothing's alright with you
You're all that's wrong
With your dumbass song
Yet that's all that you will ever be
Nothing you can do 'cause
That's all that you will ever be

To commit the crime of catching your glimpse
 
Should I call it my madness

They talk only about you
If you look into my dreams
I fall in love only with you
 
Call it my love

Ball-eyes and their lip-mouths in the night,
And stumbling through the street they say,
""Sir, do you got a light?""
And if you do then you're my friend,
And if you don't then you're my foe,
And if you are a deity of any sort
Then please don't go.

And down on Lexington they're wearing
New shoes stuck to aging feet,
And close their eyes and open,
And not recognize the aging street,
And think about how things were right
When they were young and veins were tight
And if you are the ghost of Christmas Past
Then won't you stay the night?

Sledding down snow-covered slopes
And frozen noses, frozen toes

And yes, the know New York will thaw

Then play along and catch a cold!

Yeah, I've bathed in sunshine

It seemed to be like the perfect thing for you and me
It's so ironic you're what I had pictured you to be
But there are facts in our lives
We can never change
Just tell me that you understand and feel the same
This perfect romance that I've created in my mind
I'd live a thousand lives
Each one with you right by my side
But yet we find ourselves in a less than perfect circumstance
And so it seems like we'll never have the chance
Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny
And you can't move on even though you try
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life
And you don't wanna face what's wrong or right
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart

Sometimes I think that a true love can never be
I just believe that somehow it wasn't meant for me
Life can be cruel in a way that I can't explain
And I don't think that I could face it all again
I barely know you but somehow I know what you're about
A deeper love I've found in you
And I no longer doubt
You've touched my heart and it altered every plan I've made
And now I feel that I don't have to be afraid

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny
And you can't move on even though you try
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life
And you don't wanna face what's wrong or right
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart

I locked away my heart
But you just set it free
Emotions I felt
Held me back from what my life should be
I pushed you far away
And yet you stayed with me
I guess this means
That you and me were meant to be",1

See the blue suburban dream,

Sleep away and dream a dream

Ahh, and everything will flow
Ahh, you know everything will flow
Ahh...
Watch the day begin again,
Whispering into the night,
See the pretty people play,
Hurrying under the light,
A million cars, a million trains,
Under the jet plane sky
Nothing lost and nothing gained
Life is just a lullaby
Ahh, and everything will flow
Ahh, I said everything will flow
Ahh, you know everything will flow
Ahh...

Ahh, and everything will flow
Ahh, you know everything will flow
The neon lights in the night tonight
will say ""everything will flow""
The stars that shine in the open sky
will say ""everything will flow""
The lovers kissed with an openness
will say ""everything will flow""
The cars parked in the hypermarket
know ""everything will flow""

To have it swept away

Don't you stand there and then tell me
You love me, then leave again

Say you love me

Hang 'em to the left of me 'cause my right hand man
Is my mic stand and the microphone that I own
And my game plan is keeping at a steady pace
Ain't no need for a rush it ain't no race

I'ma hit the top just when I wanna
And it's a matter of time and I'm gonna
'Cause I know when to go 'head enter
The classic Moe Dee rap that sent ya

Runnin' around holdin' ya head
Askin' ya homeboy yo man
You hear what he said another funky rhythm
Look at ya man and give him a high five

'Cause I'm live runnin' around with him
Telling everybody hanging out on the block
It's time to wake up and check the clock
Punch it I go to work, I go to work
I go to work like an architect

I build a rhyme some times it climbs so erect
Skyscrapers look like atoms
Cars electrons rollin' in patterns
Writing out word after word

With each letter it becomes visibly better
'Cause my foundation built a nation of rappers
And after I came off vacation I came to roam the land I own
And stand alone on the microphone daddy's home

Open the door playtime is over
Time to go to work and show the
Suckers in the place who run their face
The base and a taste of who's the ace

Start the race I'm coming in first
With each verse I build a curse
So rappers can't capture Moe Dee's rapture
After I got ya I have to slap ya

Senseless with endless rhymes don't pretend this
Is anything short of stupendous
And when this rhyme is done your mind will become
So trapped in the rap you'll lust on another one
You gotta wait it takes time

I don't write I build a rhyme
I draw plans draft the diagrams
An architect in effect and it slams
And if it's weak when I'm done
Renovate and build another one

I go to work I go to work I go to work like a boxer
Train the brain and aim to out fox ya
Like a punch my rhyme knocks ya
Some times it rocks ya

So hard it stops ya dead in your tracks
So power packed before you can react
You're flat on your back down for the count
Get up and dismount 'cause I'm coming
With an endless amount of words in a hurry like a flurry

A collage to camouflage the power punch but don't worry
Knowledge is an antidote I got hand of smoke
Writing at the speed of light with insight
I wrote rhymes at a level so you can't relate unless you're intelligent

So stay awake sleepwalkers slick talkers
This time a native New Yorker's
Riding a crescendo wave to save the mental
State of the fan so he can understand my pencil

Rhymes in its highest form I'm a drop it on ya like a bomb
When it explodes I'll blow up a few casualties but so what
If you're slow you blow you know you go I flow
I throw all pro I go to work I go to work To say rap is not work

Is ludicrous whoever said it must be new to this
When you hear me you'll compare me to a prophet for profit not merely
Putting words together for recreation each rhyme's a dissertation
You wanna know my occupation, I get paid to rock the nation
I go to work, I go to work, I go to work",3
"Diamonds, roses I need Moses
To cross this sea of loneliness, part this red river of pain
I don't necessarily buy any key to the future or happiness
But I need a little place in the sun sometimes or I think I will die

But everywhere is somewhere and nowhere is near
Everybody got somebody with their wine and their beer
So I'm just this tragic figure in the corner over here
With an empty apartment and a best friend who is a queer

Every time I see him he smiles 
And tells me how well he is walking these miles
But he never ever asks a single thing about me
If I die he'd hear about it eventually

Diamonds, roses I need Moses
To cross this sea of loneliness, part this red river of pain

An everywhere is somewhere and nowhere is near
Everybody got somebody with their wine and their beer
So I'm just this tragic figure in the corner over here
Go home to an empty apartment and call a best friend who is queer

To cross this sea of loneliness, part this red river of pain

Release my whole desire,
Undenied,
Totally.

And so bare is my heart,
I can't hide,
And so where does my heart,
Belong.

Beneath your tender touch,
My senses can't divide,
Oh so strong,
My desire.

For so bare is my heart,
I can't hide,
And so where does my heart,
Belong.

Now that I've found you,
And seen behind those eyes,
How can I,
Carry on.

I can't hide,
And so where does my heart,

There's vomit on his sweater already' mom's spaghetti

To drop bombs' but he keeps on forgettin
What he wrote down' the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth' but the words won'te out
He's chokin' how everybody's jokin now
The clock's run out' time's up over' bloah!
Snap back to reality' Oh there goes gravity
Oh' there goes Rabbit' he choked

Is he? No
He won't have it ' he knows his whole back city's ropes
It don't matter' he's dope
He knows that' but he's broke
He's so stacked that he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home' that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo

You better lose yourself in the music' the moment

This world is mine for the taking
Make me king' as we move toward a' new world order
A normal life is borin' but superstardom's close to post mortar
It only grows harder' only grows hotter
He blows us all over these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows' he's know as the globetrotter
Lonely roads' God only knows
He's grown farther from home' he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cuz here goes the cold water
His bosses don't want him no mo' he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds
I suppose it's old potna' but the beat goes on

No more games' I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this mothafuckin roof off like 2 dogs caged
I was playin in the beginnin' the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin and stepwritin the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
That I can't get by with my 9 to 5
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
Cuz man' these goddam food stamps don't buy diapers
And it's no movie' there's no Mekhi Phifer' this is my life
And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder
Tryin to feed and water my seed' plus
See dishonor caught up bein a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama's screamin on and
Too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot' another jam or not
Has gotten me to the point' I'm like a snail
I've got to formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only mothafuckin option' failure's not
Mom' I love you' but this trail has got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I go is my shot.
Feet fail me not cuz maybe the only opportunity that I got
You better lose yourself in the music' the moment
You own it' you better never let it go
You only get one shot' do not miss your chance to blow

And in the daylight I don't pick up my phone
Cause in the daylight anywhere feels like home

I have five clocks in my life
And only one has the time right
I'll just unplug it for today
I'll just unplug it for today

This car might make a good old boat
And float down grand street in daylight
And float down grand street in daylight
And float down grand street in daylight

And with just half of a sunburn
New yellow lines that I earned
Step back and here comes the night time

and you have closed your eyes
I wish I didn＇t have to make
all those mistakes and be wise

Please try to be patient
and know that I＇m still learning
I＇m sorry that you have to see
the strength inside me burning

Where are you my angel now
don＇t you see me crying?
And I know that you can＇t do it all
but you can＇t say I＇m not trying
I＇m on my knees in front of him
but he doesn＇t seem to see me
But all his troubles on his minds
he＇s looking right through me
And I＇m letting myself down
beside you this fire in you
And I wish that you could see
that half my troubles too

Looking at you sleeping
I＇m with the man I love
I＇m still here weeping
while the hours pass so slow

And I know that in the morning
I＇ll have to let you go
And you＇ll be just a man
once I used to know
And for these past few days
someone I don＇t recognise
This isn＇t all my fault
when, when will you realise

Looking at you leaving
I＇m looking for a sign

"While Kansas city sleeps
Cloaked in the twilight of this valley
At this church is lined with
Roadside poetry
I could to the most desolate seclusions
My blackest secrets still imprison me
And why don't we say what we really feel?

Whenever things are at their best...
Whatever lies will help you rest
Whenever things are at their best...
Why do we wait for it to fall apart?

Waking to the after-taste
Of cheap wine and bad decisions
My heart trembles in this morning glare
I could shield my eyes
From these inner most seductions
But still somehow you'll find me there

Whenever things are at their best...
Whatever lies will help you rest

I'm not the world safest bet

You
You better be alone
No I''m not obsessed
But if I catch you with somebody else
You know that I am gonna be upset

I truly believe that the reason I''m here
Is to tell you the truth that your ending is near
One day you must look at yourself in mirror
I still don''t think you are hearing me clear
You must understand that our friendship is done
Justified by the person that you have become
And because of the fact that enough is enough
Now the one that is holding the gun!

Because the cops are knocking on the door
They''re gonna wanna know what''s up!
Better tell them that you fell
Cause when they see the bruises on my face
They''re probably taking both of us to jail

I''m sick and tired of fighting each other
The lying, the crying, the calling your mother
The calling of names, I''m bothered and smothered
We kiss and make up, get under the covers
A dangerous cycle I don''t understand
The kicking and screaming, the breaking of limbs
I''ll be damned if I see you with some other man
If I cannot have you, then nobody can

"You should've been there
Should've burst through the door
With that 'baby I'm right here' smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars had just aligned
And I would've been so happy

Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I've been
As I come back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no-one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
But there's one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
when there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
""He said he'd be here.""

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no-one to impress
And they're all laughing
And asking me about you
But there's one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

What do you say
When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do when the one
Who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show?

You should've been here
And I would've been so happy

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no-one to impress
And they're all standing around me singing
Happy Birthday to you
But there's one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

Ooh, I knew.

You call me later
And say I'm sorry I didn't make it
And I say I'm sorry too
And that was the moment I knew

"It was a dark and clouded night
Where neither star nor moon would shine
Yet standing in a pool of light
Like Saturn with its rings

A lonesome figure gleamed
So tall and wild and evergreen
With roots that reached out for the sea
Like dancers in the wind

Oh, hi
Love

So far from
From me

Those salt cliffs can’t be scaled
The evidence of those who failed
Their skeletons lay strange and frail
Like lace among the rocks

So content to sit and wait
So dedicated to your fate
To never move, to never chase
You just stand up there and watch

Oh, hi
Love

So high up
Will you always be
Out of reach?

Oh, hi
Love

Oh, why
Love?

I wish that you would
Jump
But I can see
Your ties run deep

And it’s not for me
To cut you free

Brooks run into the ocean, man

That ole ocean run into the sea

Well now, I don't find my baby blue,
somebody sure gonna bury me

Seems like my baby would stop her old evil way

Would stop her low down ways

And deep inside is massive building
There’s a crystal lake of all the tears I've cried.

I will tell them why

"First thing we'd climb a tree 
And maybe then we'd talk
Or sit silently 
And listen to our thoughts
With illusions of someday 
Casting a golden light
No dress rehearsal
This is our life

And that's where the hornet stung me
And I had a feverish dream
With revenge and doubt
Tonight we smoke them out

You are ahead by a century (this is our life)
You are ahead by a century (this is our life)
You are ahead by a century

Stare in the morning shroud 
And then the day began
I tilted your cloud
You tilted my hand
Rain falls in real time 
And rain fell through the night
No dress rehearsal
This is our life

But that's when the hornet stung me
And I had a serious dream
With revenge and doubt
Tonight we smoke them out

You are ahead by a century (this is our life)
You are ahead by a century (this is our life)

You've launched a secret heart with your face
You don't always say what I want to hear but you move me
Across the rooftops and into the deep blue sea

Are we just heroes for a day
This time I will stand by you
And mine is the heart I will save

I drew a hard line but I just can't see it
Your colours are bleeding all over my bullshit
I wanna be your star but I gotta learn to feel myself
I want your love and I need your help

Did we not choose each other
Are we just heroes for a day
This time I will stand by you
And mine is the heart I will save
Can we not judge each other

I can follow my heart till the end

Just because we live like dolphins together
So many reasons to break the wave
We can swim from streetlamp to streetlamp
We can be kissing in the rain

Can we not judge each other
I'd rather wipe your tears away
I can follow my heart till the end
But I just can't choose the way

Listen baby, listen baby don't you do me wrong
I can make my bed, you can sing your song
Ain't nobody else gonna make you shine
If it's the truth you seek then darlin' love you'll find
I don't wanna, I don't wanna take your pain away
Isn't yours to give, isn't mine to save

With your hand in my hand, still feel feel the love
Really wish that we could go back to the way that it was.

Just to get you back again.
I can not wait, I can not wait,
If we can be, we can be us again.
I cry at night, cry at night, I'll cry for all the words,
All the words I didn't say.
Sweet Sundays, sweet Sundays.

"Cool breeze and autumn leaves
Slow motion daylight
A lone pair of watchful eyes
Oversee the living
Feel the presence all around
A tortured soul
A wound unhealing
No regrets or promises
The past is gone
But you can still be free...
If time will set you free...

Time now to spread your wings
To take to flight
The life endeavor
Aim for the burning sun
You're trapped inside
But you can still be free...
If time will set you free...
But it's a long long way to go

Keep moving way up high
You see the light
It shines forever
Sail through the crimson skies
The purest light
The light that sets you free...
If time will set you free...

Sail through the wind and rain tonight
You're free to fly tonight
And you can still be free...
If time will set you free...
And go high like the mountain tops
And go high like the wind don't stop
And go high
Hoo
Free to fly tonight
Free to fly tonight",4

A reason to fight is not making a stronger man
'Cause they don't understand!

"My best friend gave me the best advice
He said each day's a gift and not a given right
Leave no stone unturned, Leave your fears behind
And try to take the path less traveled by
That first step you take is the longest stride

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have?
If today was your last day,
If today was your last day.

Against the grain should be a way of life
What's worth the price is always worth the fight
Every second counts 'cause there's no second try,
So live like you'll never live it twice
Don't take the free ride in your own life

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past
Donate every dime you have?
Would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories
Would you forgive your enemies?
Would you find that one you're dreamin' of
Swear up and down to God above
That you finally fall in love
If today was your last day

If today was your last day...
Would you make your mark
By mending a broken heart?
You know it's never too late
To shoot for the stars,
Regardless of who you are
So do whatever it takes
'cause you can't rewind
A moment in this life
Let nothin' stand in your way
'cause the hands of time
Are never on your side

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late,
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?

Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past

Chasing the clouds away

Something calls to me
The trees are drawing me near
I've got to find out why
Those gentle voices I hear
Explain it all with a sigh",4
"I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again 
But always in my heart

Oh, this love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breakin' in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
Whoa, whoa, whoa

I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Oh, kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again

But uh-oh, this love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breakin' in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
Whoa, whoa, whoa

I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's all right (It's all right, it's all right)
My pressure on your hips
I'm sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
'Cause I know that's what you want me to do

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
Her heart is breakin' in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And my heart is breakin' in front of me
She said goodbye too many times before

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before 
Her heart is breakin' in front of me
But I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore...",1

You don't need to tell me it's over

I don't need to know why

Well

"City headache subsides your dreary tone
Send a doctor to my house
Got me a fever coming round the bend
A heavy busload of danger

Straight talking you're sending me to bed
'Cause I ain't walking, in my state
A temperature that will not go away
So let it build up in my head

My head...

Prescribed pills just throw them down the sink
Cause in the hills is my cure.
No city headache to knock on my front door
No spewing faces to bug me.

Your output level brings thunder to my ears
A peaking signal from your mouth
Some cleansing water to wash away the grime of city laughter
Off my face.

My face...

It's not for me
The speed in which you walk
Would burn the soles of my feet.
Congested and choking from the fog
Of chain-smoking freak shows
That's how it goes so you just find the road
And pack your bags, for no more...",2

As you lay in bed, thinking about everything that you did not do
'Cause saying I love you has nothing to do with meaning it, ohh

And I don't trust you
'Cause every time you're here
Your intentions are unclear
I spend every hour waiting for a phone call
That I know will never come
I used to think you were the one
Now I'm sick of thinking anything at all 

You ain't never coming back to me

You take my hand just to give it back

Do you remember the way we used to melt?
Do you remember how it felt when I touched you?
Oh, 'cause I remember very well

And how long has it been
Since someone you let in
Has given what I gave to you?
And at night, when you sleep
Did you dream I would be there
Just for a minute or two, do you?

You ain't never coming back to me
That's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back

And the only time I've touched you is in my sleep.

But time has changed nothing at all -
You're still the only one that feels like home.
I've tried cutting the ropes and
I let you go but you're still the only one
That feels like home.

You won't talk me into it next time,
If I'm going away your hearts coming too.

Tried letting go but you're still the only one

Oh tell me, did you really think
I had gone when you couldn't see me anymore?
When you couldn't...

"Yeah, what you critics said would never happen
We dedicate this album to anybody people said couldn't make it
To the fans that held us down till everybody came around
Welcome, it's here

That summer we took threes across the board
But by fall we were a cover story
Now in stores

Make us poster boys in your scene
But we are not making an acceptance speech

I have found the safest place to keep all of our mistakes
Every dot-com's refreshing for a journal update

So long live the car-crash hearts
Cry on the couch all the poets come to life
Fix me in 45

So long live the car-crash hearts
Cry on the couch all the poets come to life
Fix me in 45

I can take your problems away
With a nod and a wave of my hand
'Cause that's just the kind of boy that I am

The only thing I haven't done yet is die
And it's me and my plus one in the afterlife
Crowds are won and lost and won again
But our hearts beat for the diehards

So long live the car-crash hearts
Cry on the couch all the poets come to life
Fix me in 45

So long live the car-crash hearts
Cry on the couch all the poets come to life
Fix me in 45

Long live the car-crash hearts
Long live the car-crash hearts
(Long live the car-crash hearts)

Long live the car-crash hearts
Long live the car-crash hearts

Long live the car-crash hearts
Cry on the couch all the poets come to life

"She put him out like the burnin\' end of a midnight cigarette

She broke his heart he spent his whole life tryin\' to forget
We watched him drink his pain away a little at a time
But he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind
Until the night
----------1st Chorus---------
He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger 
And finally drank away her memory 
Life is short but this time it was bigger 
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees 
We found him with his face down in the pillow 
With a note that said I\'ll love her till I die 
And when we buried him beneath the willow 
The angels sang a whiskey lullaby 
lala lala
(Sing lullaby)
The rumors flew but nobody knew how much she blamed herself 
For years and years she tried to hide the whiskey on her breath 
She finally drank her pain away a little at a time 
But she never could get drunk enough to get him off her mind 
Until the night 
2nd Chorus
She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger 
And finally drank away his memory 
Life is short but this time it was bigger 
Than the strength she had to get up off her knees 
We found her with her face down in the pillow 
Clinging to his picture for dear life 
We laid her next to him beneath the willow 
While the angels sang a whiskey lullaby

"I look, at you all, see the love, there that's sleeping,
while my guitar, gently weeps.
I look, at the floor, and I see it needs sweeping,
still my guitar, gently weeps.
I don't know why, nobody told you,
how to unfold your love.

I don't know how, someone controlled you,
they bought and sold you.
I look, at the world, and I notice it's turning,
while my guitar, gently weeps.
With every mistake, we must surely, be learning,
still my guitar, gently weeps

I don't know how, you were diverted,
you were perverted, too.
I don't know how, you were inverted,
no one alerted you.
I look, at you all, see the love,
there that's sleeping,
while my guitar, gently weeps.
Look at you all...

Still my guitar, gently weeps.

I will carry you down and
I won’t make a sound

and breathe in the pristine crime scene
The false veneer is old like

So what if we beg to differ my friend?
That dissolves away as fast as gravity will take me

"Dirty your face
With longing and grace, God-given
Suffer her heart
And love her when your love goes unrequited
Where the cool winds blow
I must surely go
For my love calls me below to drag her
From the depths of my soul
When will I see her again?
The other side of friends
The darkened claws of death
The empty breath desire

Dirty your face
With longing and grace, God-given
Suffer her heart
And love her when your love goes unrequited
Restless in my speech
And ruthless in my teach
So vacant in my breach
I drive the dirt up her garden
Sorrow
She'll never listen again
No other lovers to bend
Just rotten apples to eat
Just letter yellowed distant scorn

Dirty your face
With longing and grace, God-given
Suffer her heart
And love her when your love goes unrequited
Life just fades away
Purity just begs
Dust to dust, we're wired into sadness",2
"Farewell my child it's time
To leave this all behind 
Exchanging the river for the sea 
Farewell to saturday's child 
Cut loose before his prime 
Set adrift in the city 
Speak to me now of isolation 
Feel your way home in the dark 

Here comes the old greay man 
Back bent before his time 
Tracing figures in the sand 
He has no more crosses to bear 
Sat upon his rocking chair 
Gazes out toward the sea 
Speak to me now of visions 
Seen through a looking glass mind 

Speak of your inhibitions 
You still have your mountain to climb 
End....

"You want to stay with me in the morning
You only hold me when I sleep,
I was meant to tread the water
Now I've gotten in too deep,
For every piece of me that wants you
Another piece backs away.

'Cause you give me something
That makes me scared, alright,
This could be nothing
But I'm willing to give it a try,
Please give me something
'Cause someday I might know my heart.

You already waited up for hours
Just to spend a little time alone with me,
And I can say I've never bought you flowers
I can't work out what the mean,
I never thought that I'd love someone,
That was someone else's dream.

'Cause you give me something
That makes me scared, alright,
This could be nothing
But I'm willing to give it a try,
Please give me something,
'Cause someday I might call you from my heart,
But it might me a second too late,
And the words I could never say
Gonna come out anyway.

'Cause you give me something
That makes me scared, alright,
This could be nothing
But I'm willing to give it a try,
Please give me something,
'Cause you give me something
That makes me scared, alright,
This could be nothing
But I'm willing to give it a try,
Please give me something
'Cause someday I might know my heart.
Know my heart, know my heart, know my heart

"Sunrise sunrise
Looks like morning in your eyes
But the clocks had nine fifteen for hours

Sunrise sunrise
Couldn't tempt us if it tried
Cause the afternoon's already come and gone
And I said
hooohooo hooohooo hooohooo
Do you

Surprise surprise
Couldn't find it in your eyes
But I'm sure it's written all over my face

Surprise surprise
Never something I could hide
When I see we've made through another day
Then I say
hooohoo hooohooo hooohooo
Do you

Now the night
throw its cover down
mmm on me again
Ooo and if I'm right
It's the only way to bring me back
Hooohooo hooohooo hooohooo
Do you
Hooohooo hooohooo hooohooo
Do you

"I knocked out Buster Johnson,
On the playground after school.
I went from being a 3rd grade punk,
To 6th grade cool.
Yeah, I still hold the land speed record,
Down county road 5-0-9.
Judge Taylor said he was real impressed,
But wouldn't waive the fine.
Yeah, I still got my picture on the bait shop wall,
With a 6 lb. Smallmouth Bass.
Ha, I see that I'm still loved and hated on that overpass.

Yeah, I got a name in this town,
Some good, and some bad that I'll never live down.
Anywhere else I'm just a face in the crowd,
But I got a name in this town.
Yeah, I got a name in this town.

Might have to fight my way out of Lucy's,
When I show up tonight.
'Round here it seems old scores,
Old flames man they never die.
Then again it might just be a bunch of back slappin',
When I walk through that door.
Here the same old stories,
That keep gettin' bigger than they were before.
I packed my things and hitched my dreams,
To a superstar.
And if the world out there,
Don't give a damn about me or this guitar.
It won't matter at all

'Cause I got a name in this town,
Some good, and some bad that I'll never live down,
Anywhere else I'm just a face in the crowd,

Been called a few things I can't say right now,
A little hard-headed and a little to proud,

"Hey girl
Is he everything you wanted in a man?
You know I gave you the world
You had me in the palm of your hand

So why your love went away
I just can't seem to understand
Thought it was me and you, baby
Me and you until the end
But I guess I was wrong

Don't want to think about it
Don't want to talk about it

Just so confused about it
Feeling the blues about it
I just can't do without you

Is this how we say goodbye?

I remember everything that you claimed
You said that you were moving on now (on now)
And maybe I should do the same (maybe I should do the same)

Funny thing about that is
I was ready to give you my name
Thought it was me and you, baby
And now, it's all just a shame
And I guess I was wrong

Don't want to think about it, no
Don't want to talk about it, hmm

Let me paint this picture for you baby

You spend your nights alone
And he never comes home
And every time you call him
All you get's a busy tone

I heard you found out
That he's doing to you
What you did to me
Ain't that the way it goes

When you cheated, girl
My heart bleeded, girl
So it goes without saying
That you left me feeling hurt

Just a classic case
A scenario
Tale as old as time
Girl you got what you deserved

And now you want somebody
To cure the lonely nights
You wish you had somebody
That could come and make it right

But girl I ain't somebody
I'm out of sympathy
You'll see

Some men you just can't reach...
So, you get what we had here last week,

Well, he gets it!
N' I don't like it any more than you men."" *
Look at your young men fighting
Look at your women crying
Look at your young men dying
The way they've always done before
Look at the hate we're breeding
Look at the fear we're feeding
Look at the lives we're leading
The way we've always done before
My hands are tied
The billions shift from side to side
And the wars go on with brainwashed pride
For the love of God and our human rights
And all these things are swept aside
By bloody hands time can't deny
And are washed away by your genocide
And history hides the lies of our civil wars
D'you wear a black armband
When they shot the man
Who said ""Peace could last forever""
And in my first memories
They shot Kennedy
I went numb when I learned to see
So I never fell for Vietnam
We got the wall of D.C. to remind us all
That you can't trust freedom
When it's not in your hands
When everybody's fightin'
For their promised land
And
I don't need your civil war
It feeds the rich while it buries the poor
Your power hungry sellin' soldiers
In a human grocery store
Ain't that fresh
I don't need your civil war
Look at the shoes your filling
Look at the blood we're spilling
Look at the world we're killing
The way we've always done before
Look in the doubt we've wallowed
Look at the leaders we've followed
Look at the lies we've swallowed
And I don't want to hear no more
My hands are tied
For all I've seen has changed my mind
But still the wars go on as the years go by
With no love of God or human rights
'Cause all these dreams are swept aside
By bloody hands of the hypnotized
Who carry the cross of homicide
And history bears the scars of our civil wars
""We practice selective annihilation of mayors
And government officials
For example to create a vacuum
Then we fill that vacuum
As popular war advances

I don't need your civil war
It feeds the rich while it buries the poor
Your power hungry sellin' soldiers
In a human grocery store
Ain't that fresh
And I don't need your civil war
I don't need your civil war
I don't need your civil war

Makes no difference who you are
Anything your heart desires
Will come to you

If your heart is in your dream
No request is too extreme

She brings to those who love
The sweet fulfillment of
Their secret longing

Like a bolt out of the blue
Fate steps in and sees you through
When you wish upon a star
You dreams come true

"The innocence of sleeping children dressed in white and slowly dreaming stops all time
I slow my steps and start to blur, so many years have filled my heart, I never thought I'd say those words

(The further we go and older we grow, the more we know, the less we show
The further we go and older we grow, the more we know, the less we show)

The very first time I saw your face I thought of a song and quickly changed the tune
The very first time I touched your skin I thought of a story and rushed to reach the end too soon
Oh, remember. Oh, please don't change

So the fall came, thirteen years, a shiny ring and how I could forget your name
The air no longer in my throat, another perfect lie is choked but it always feels the same

So they close together, dressed in red and yellow, innocent forever. Sleeping children in their blue soft rooms still dream

"I'm gonna die in these four walls
I've had enough and I've tried it all
I'll watch the day break and I'll see the night fall

In these four walls

Show me trouble and I'll take him down

I drew a line on this patch of ground

Everything's safe and everything's sound

In these four walls

Up on the rooftop
I can remember
Borders I had to break
Now I can see I have a life
To make

I'm gonna miss your southern drawl
A baby's footsteps in an empty hall
And every little thing I can ever recall
In these four walls

Up on the rooftop
Feel like you're flying
Thinking your heart could break
Oh can't you see we have this love

To make

I'm gonna die in these four walls
I've had enough and I've tried it all

I'll watch the day break and I'll see the night fall

And then the cold came the dark days

I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinkin
Probably mindless dreamin
If we loved again I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it but I can't

"Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I’ll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance
But you still catch my eyes
Tell me baby, do you recognize me
Well it’s been a year
It doesn’t surprise me

Merry Christmas
I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying I love you I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if u kiss me now
I know you'll fool me again

Last Christmas I gave you my heart

Friends with tired eyes
I’m hidding from you and your soul vival
My god i thought you were Someone to rely on Me
I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A gril under cover but you tore her apart
Maybe next year, Maybe next year,
I’ll give it to someone special

Cause Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I’ll give it to someone special

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I’ll give it to someone special
And last Christmas

And this year
It won't be anything like, anything like
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I’ll give it to someone special

"Ooh, baby
Anytime my world gets crazy
All I have to do to calm it
Is just think of you

'Cause when I think of you, baby
Nothin' else seems to matter
'Cause when I think of you, baby
All I think about is our love

I just get
More attached to you when
You hold me in your arms and squeeze me
And you leave me, makin' me blue

'Cause then I think of you, baby
Nothin' else seems to matter
'Cause when I think of you, baby
All I think about is our love

So in love (so in love)

We were so young,I can't forget
How you kissed my face, whoa
And you took me home, whoa
I remember the life years ago
The air mattress on the floor

That was before, whoa

Life took control

Oh, how we lost our minds

When we fell in love that night

I never thought that I

Would ever leave your side

Oh, how we lost our minds

When we fell in love that night

Promise me you won't cry

This is our last goodbye

When I was lost, I found you
When I was broke
you bought me shoes
You were my first, whoa
And dammit this hurts, whoa
Now you've got a girl,
someone new
And I can't pretend to just be cool
I can't be your friend, whoa
So this is the end

Oh, how we lost our minds
When we fell in love that night

I never thought that I

Would ever leave your side

Oh, how we lost our minds
When we fell in love that night
Promise me you won't cry

This is our last goodbye

"Breathe, and I'll carry you away into the velvet sky
And we'll stir the stars around
And watch them fall away into the Hudson Bay
And plummet out of sight and sound

The open summer breeze will sweep you through the hills
Where I live in the Alpine Heights
Below the Northern Lights, I spend my coldest nights
Alone, awake, and thinking of
The weekend we were in love

(The weekend we were in love)

Home among these mountaintops can be so awfully dull
A thousand miles from the tide
But photos on the walls of New York shopping malls
Distract me so I stay inside

I wish the rockets stayed over the Promenade
'Cause I would make a hook and eye
And fish them from the sky, my darling, she and I
We're hanging on so take us high
To sing the world goodbye

I am floating away
Lost in a silent ballet
I'm dreaming you're out in the blue
And I am right beside you
Awake to take in the view

Late nights and early parades
Still photos and noisy arcades
My darling we're both on the wing
Look down and keep on singing
And we can go anywhere

Are you there?
(Are you there? Are you there? Are you there?)
Are you there?
(Are you there? Are you there? Are you there?)
Or are you just a decoy dream in my head?
Am I home or am I simply tumbling all alone?

I am floating away (floating away)
Lost in a silent ballet (silent ballet)
I'm dreaming you're out in the blue
And I am right beside you
Awake to take in the view

Late nights and early parades (and early parades)
Still photos and noisy arcades (noisy arcades)
My darling we're both on the wing
Look down and keep on singing
And we can go anywhere

Just to have you back

So step out the queue, he makes examples of you
And there's naught you can say
Behind they go through to the bit where you pay
And you realize then that it's finally the time
To walk back past ten thousand eyes in the line

And you can swap jumpers and make another move
Instilled in your brain you've got something to prove
To all the smirking faces and the boys in black
Why can't they be pleasant? Why can't they have a laugh?

They want arms flying everywhere and bottles as well

buried in the dark, I'm creeping

Don't be concerned, it's just the power of a breaking heart.
How good am I hiding it? look, I've got some bad intentions.
Guilty as fucking charged.
Still standing stable, more than able
Cause I know who you are.
I know the birthdays, anniversaries, all the first days I missed.
I regret them all.
But now I know this:

I know that God exists, I held her in my arms.
I never knew I was able to ever feel this strong.
Take me off your worry list, it'll be better that way.
I'm really fine and there's nothing we haven't talked about.
So, take me off your worry list I said, ""Throw it away.""
This is what my life is about.

What kind of man would take the trust you break and still follow through?
'Cause I'm standin' right here.
And you may not show up.
This same gate 14 where, honestly, I'm just sick of calling your bluff.
And it's just embarrassing, that I nearly threw up
Well I'm trying hard to change the things I always screw up.
And at the top of my list, this visitation's no relationship.
But I gotta make the best of it.
'Cause I know -

I know that God exists, I held her in my arms.

Nobody's at home.

I'm packin' it up, and I'm comin' today.

This is what your story's about.
My pretty little girl, can you figure it out?
If it helps to know so there is no doubt,
Just listen to the stories, not everything is glorious.
Some hurt, some love, some shout.
I fought the world and I lost that bout.
And you are what my album's about.
I might have been gone, but I never walked out.

"You hold me inside your iris
a terminal stain on life
You condescend to my primal brain
and twist me around like a knife
Can't begin to explain
The feelings I have restrained
Don't ask me how I am
Because you're too busy planning your epitaph
Let me tell you
DON'T - try to be the ONE - person
Who has STAYED - just to say
They never left me!
Aggravated, complicated, someone say it
You keep me hidden behind a curtain,
You feed me orchids to give me courage
and keep me in line with disdain
Can't begin to explain
The feelings I have restrained
Don't ask me how I am
Because you're too busy planning your epitaph
Let me tell you
DON'T - try to be the ONE - person
Who has STAYED - just to say
They never left me!
Aggravated, complicated, someone say it
I have nothing left for you
you left me with nothing
I have nothing left for you
I live at arm's length and die a little,
between your constants by day
I want my soul back before it's over,
I can't even wish you away
Can't begin to explain
The feelings I have restrained
Don't ask me how I am
Because you're too busy planning your epitaph
Let me tell you
DON'T - try to be the ONE - person
Who has STAYED - just to say
They never left me!
Aggravated, complicated, someone say it
I NEVER LEARN!!

"When I grow up
I want to be a forester
Run through the moss on high heels
That's what I'll do
Throwing out a boomerang
Waiting for it to come back to me

When I grow up
I want to live near the sea
Crab claws and bottles of rum
That's what I'll have
Staring at the seashell
Waiting for it to embrace me

I put my soul in what I do
Last night I drew a funny man
With dog eyes and a hanging tongue
It goes way bad
I never like that sad look
From someone who wants to be loved by you

I'm very good with plants
When my friends are away
They let me keep the soil moist
On the seventh day I rest
For a minute or two
Then back on my feet to call for you

You've got cucumbers on your eyes
Too much time spent on nothing
Waiting for a moment to arise
The face in the ceiling
And arms too long
I'm waiting for him to catch me

Waiting for it to embrace me oh",2

"Cast your eyes into the distance
Try to focus on it all
Find a spirit of resistance
Instead of pride before the fall
Forge some opposition
From disparate strands
It ain't the prettiest position
As a century ends

Unstable situation
Faces made of wax
Streams of melting glass
Sheets of butchered facts
The roar of the machine
Hooded hearts and jewelled hands
And anger spilling out like gasoline
As a century ends

Everything i seen, everything that i heard,
Ain't even the tip of the iceberg
Fire down memory lane
So pass me my rose tinted glasses again

Through a fog of contradiction
Out to the lake of tears
See society admiring its own reflection
Chase a light that shines and disappears
Careful what you say 'cos reality offends
Just sit back and let your soul decay
As a century ends

And its easy to get weary
As you fight to get it done
gainst a popular theory
That it's over 'fore it's even begun
Strain the limit of compassion
Tend a wound that never mends
And honesty still out of fashion
As a century ends
As a century ends
As a century ends....

If I were to walk by you once more
Maybe you will look into my eyes
and you will see just what you've done to me
Time is short

You know we only live one life

It was love at first sight

And being by your side is the only thing on my mind

On Atlantic shore

When we cannot hear and understand ourselves
With a soul full of music
Still refusing to dance
But you knew all the old songs
You're a stranger no more

Let me tell you how it's gonna be
I'm gonna kill anyone who steps up in front of me
Welcome to the same ol' fucking scam
Same ol' shit in a dead fad
Everybody wants to be so hard
Are you real or a second rate sports card?
They all lost their dad or their wife just died
They never got to go outside - shut up
Nobody gives a fuck
It doesn't change the fact that you suck

We are the only answer
Stripped down' we want you dead
But what's inside of me' you'll never know
We are bipolar gods

And i don't think i need this anymore

Now i'm not pretty and i'm not cool
But i'm fat and i'm ugly and proud - so fuck you
Standing out is the new pretension
Sreamline the ness' half-assed aggression
You gotta see it to believe it' we all got conned
All the mediocre sacred cows we spawne
Put your trust in the mission
We will not repent - this is our religion

Everybody dies' shuffle on' remove it
Individuals' indispensable
I'm the paradox deity vessel
...the other side holds no secret
But this side is done' i don't need it
Before you go' you should know you're breaking down
You'll be rotten by the time you're underground

We are the anti-cancer

Stripped down' we want you dead

It's real late, 'bout a quarter to one
Thinking about everything we become
And I hate it
I thought we could make it

But I'm ready to dead this
Just wanna forget about it

And the letters she sent

You had me thinking
You were out with your friends
I'm so foolish
Play me like I'm stupid
'Cause I thought it was just you and I

That we spent and I
See it in my mind
Playing over and over again

You got me breaking down

Of the day that we met
You showed me things
That I'll never forget

Took me swimming
In the ocean
You had my head up in the clouds
Made me feel like I'm floating
You think I'm playing

When you know it's the truth
Nobody else can do it quite like I do
All my kisses
And my loving
But ain't nobody better than us

But you and I know
It's not that easy to let go
Of everything that we planned
And start all over again

Just blame yourself 'cause you blew it
I won't forget how you do it
Sweet baby this is where the game ends now
Somehow wanna believe you and me
We can figure it out

I wish that you come hold me
When I'm lonely
When I need someone to talk to

You would phone me
Just like everything you told me
(When we ride we ride, it's till the day we die)
Boy you forgot about the promises you made me
And now we'll let the memories just fade away
But I remember what you used to say

There's a rumbling in the skies
I've been wading through the high muddy water
With the heat rising in my eyes

Every day your memory grows dimmer
It doesn't haunt me like it did before
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere
Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door

When I was in Missouri
They would not let me be
I had to leave there in a hurry
I only saw what they let me see

You broke a heart that loved you
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore
I've been walking that lonesome valley
Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door

People on the platforms
Waiting for the trains
I can hear their hearts a-beatin'
Like pendulums swinging on chains

When you think that you've lost everything
You find out you can always lose a little more
I'm just going down the road feeling bad
Tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door

I'm going down the river
Down to New Orleans
They tell me everything is gonna be all right
But I don't know what ""all right"" even means

I was riding in a buggy with Miss Mary Jane
Miss Mary Jane got a house in Baltimore
I been all around the world, boys
Now I'm tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door

Gotta sleep down in the parlor
And relive my dreams
I'll close my eyes and I wonder
If everything is as hollow as it seems

Some trains don't pull no gamblers
No midnight ramblers, like they did before
I been to Sugartown, I shook the sugar down
Now I'm tryin' to get to heaven before they close the door",2
"I peek into the hole, I struggle for control
The children love the show,
but they fail to see the anguish in my eyes

I scratch around the brim, I let my mind give in
The crowd begins to grin,
but they seem to scream when darkness fills my eyes
Seem to scream when darkness fills my eyes, it's no surprise
Fail to see the tragic, turn it into magic
My big top tricks will always make you happy,
but we all know the hat is wearing me
My bag is in the hat, it's filled with this and that
My vision's getting fat, the rabbit's just a monkey in disguise
Skulls and pills and needles dance before our eyes
They will bite the hand if it is slower than
the quickness of their scrutinizing eyes
Fail to see the tragic, turn it into magic
My big top tricks will always make you happy,
but we all know the hat is wearing me
Chicanery will always make you happy,
but we all know the hat is wearing me

Translation:
I know you won't come back, 
everything that was; 
Time has left it behind. 
I know that you won't return. 
What happened between us 
will never be repeated. 
A thousand years will never reach me 
to fade you away and forget. 
And now I'm here, 
Trying to turn valleys into cities 
Mixing the Sky and the Sea. 
I know I let you escape, 
I know I lost you. 
Nothing can be the same; 
A millenium can reach 
so you can fade away. 
Chorus: 
I'm here, loving you, 
suffocating, 
in photographs and scrapbooks, 
in objects and momentos. 
I can't comprehend, 


I'm driving myself mad. 
Changing a foot for 
my own face; 
This night for a day. 
And there's nothing I can do about it. 

The letters I wrote, 
I never sent. 
You didn't want to know of me. 
I can't understand 
how foolish I was; 
It's all the matter of time and faith. 
A millenium with another thousand years... 
are enough to love

You know I'm still waiting for you...

And take the good and leave the rest
Oh, the illusion''s getting old
And you don''t answer when I call
I would have given you it all

Oh, out of sight, out of mind
It doesn''t mean you''re not mine
The feeling goes on and on and on

"Everybody wants to be a showman
Yeah they all got another one
Everybody think they got a genius
Everybody got me on the run
Sometimes I think they come here
Just so you can say that you can
And I can't get alone in my bathroom
I need to give myself a hand

Y'all cuh-cuh-cuh-creepin'
Creepin' underneath my skin
Fuck you and your flashbulbs
Snappin' my picture again
You drink all my whiskey
You steal all my smoke
And you're crowded all around me
Like I got nowhere to go

(Chorus) Eyes are gonna roll
Beggin' me to kill
Time for you to go
I'm-a-gon' spill
It ain't yo fast train
I'll be the king runnin' at the wheel
I ain't lookin' to make no deals here no

You keep stickin' to me like a prickly porcupine
You're gettin' your information from the grocery checkout line
Are ya true confessin' of your little girl obsession
'Cause I was only messin', an' I had a little time

"I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

Lately I really, feel like I'm rolling for ___ like Philly,
I feel like I'm losing control of myself, I sincerely,
I apologize if all that I sound like, is I'm complaining,
But life keeps on complicating, an' I'm debating,
On leaving this world, this evening, even my girls,
Can see I'm grievin', I try and hide it,
But I can't, why do I act like I'm all high and mighty,
When inside, I'm dying, I am finally realizing I need help.
I can't do it by myself, too weak, 2 weeks I've been having ups and downs,
Going through peaks and valleys, dilly dallying,
Around with the idea, of ending the shit right here.
I'm hatin' my reflection, I walk around the house tryin' to fight mirrors,
I can't stand what I look like, yeah, I look fat, but what do I care?
I give a fuck, only thing I fear, is Hailie,
I'm afraid if I close my eyes I might see her,
Shit..

I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes

I lock myself in the bedroom, bathroom, nappin' at noon,
Yeah dad's in a bad mood, he's always snappin' at you.
Marshall what happened at you, you can't stop with these pills,
And you've fallen off with your skills, and your own fans are laughin' at you.
It become a problem you're too pussy to tackle, get up,
Be a man, stand, a real man woulda had this shit handled.
Know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed,
They say Proof just flipped out, homie just swift out and bust,
Nah, it ain't like Doody to do that,
He wouldn't fuckin' shoot at, no-body, he fights first,
But dwellin' on it only makes the night worse,
Now I'm poppin Vic's, perks and Methadone pills.
Yeah Em, tight verse, you killed it,
Fuckin' drug dealers hang around me like ""yes man"",
And they gon' do whatever I says when, I says it,
It's in their best interest to protect their investment.
And I just lost my fuckin' best friend, so fuck it, I guess then...

I'm going through changes
Don't know what I'm going through, but I just keep on going through changes...

My friends just can't understand this new me,
That's understandable man, but just think how bananas you'd be,
You'd be an animal too, if you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo.
And everybody's lookin' at you, what you want me to do,
I'm startin' to live like a recluse and the truth is,
Fame startin' to give me an excuse, to be at a all time low.
I sit alone in my home theatre, watchin' the same damn DVD,
Of the first tour, the last tour, he was still alive.
And it hurt sore, fast forward, sleepin' pills'll make me feel alright.
And if I'm still awake in the middle of the night,
I just take a couple more, yeah you're motherfuckin' right,
I ain't slowin' down for no one, I am almost homeward bound.
Almost in a coma, yeah homie come on, don't look now,
Daddy, don't you die on me, daddy, better hold your ground.
Fuck, don't I know the sound of that voice,
Yeah baby hold me down.

I'm going through changes
Don't know what I'm going through, but I just keep on going through changes...

Wake up in the hospital, full of tubes, plus somehow I'm pullin' through.
Swear when I come back I'ma be bulletproof.
I'ma do it just for Proof, I think I should state a few,
Facts, cause I may not get a chance again to say the truth.
shit it just hit me that what if I would notta made it through?
I think about the things I would never got to say to you,
I'd never get to make it right, so here's what I came to do.
Hailie this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina too,
I still love your mother, that'll never change,
Think about her every day, we just could never get it together.
Hey, wish there was a better way, for me to say it,
But I swear on everything, I'd do anything for her on anyday.
There are just too many things, to explain, when it rains,
Guess it pours, yes it does, wish there wasn't any pain.
But I can't pretend there ain't, I ain't placin' any blame,
I ain't pointin' fingers, heaven knows there never been a saint.
I know it just feels like we just pissed away our history,
But just today, I looked at your picture, almost hate to say,
I miss you self consciously, wish it didn't end this way.
But I just had to get away, don't know why,
I don't know what else to say, I guess I'm..

I'm going through changes
Don't know what I'm going through, but I just keep on going through changes...

"I wish you could adore
The way you did before
Now you're living through another year
Oh, the light you were
Will soon become a blur
As you're living through another year

Oh, what a waste of time it is
To indulge inside of bliss
Getting ready for another year like this

Another year to lie
Another year goes by

You're not sick, so you can't heal
But I wonder do you feel
The need to cry: 'I'm out of here'
Oh, your goal is safe
But is it all you crave
As you're living through another year

Oh, what a waste of time it is
To indulge inside of bliss
Getting ready for another year like this

Another year to lie
Another year goes by

Is it me on how I see
The face of mediocrity
I try to smile you see
Your lightness darkens me
Filter all of your emotions
Fake you're never low
Or face the one you fear
You're living through another year

Another year to lie
Another year goes by
Another year to lie
Another year goes by",2

But I don't think you understand
I can be trusted now, I swear to you I can
It's been a year
A memory from my past
I know what I did wrong
I wish to change
Just to make it last
But I guess it's been to long
Easy to move on
To forget about it all
Is that what you do, hoping I will be gone
So should it matter
What I do or what I've done
As long as in my heart
You're still the only one
I hear you say it
But I don't think you understand
I can be trusted now, I swear to you I can
If you got to know me again
Maybe then - maybe then
We could see what we should do

But that's all up to you
I'll be waiting for you
So should it matter
What I do or what I've done
As long as in my heart
You're still the only one
I hear you say it

You were always a part of my destiny
I always believed, that this day had to come
There was not enough time
And too much left undone
I could never deny
Just how far we had come
I've got so much love

Then go back to it another day.
The green mind said it's okay...
Cause you know where they're gonna be.
All's you have to do is come with me.
It's cool, they're probably asleep.

On the outside,
That's where they always hide.
Come to my side
And I'll introduce you to...
Some of their kind.
I know you've always tried.
And now it's your time to take in their point of view,
Though it's nothing new.

Might be with them tonight.
Unless you decide to come n' I'll check out you.
Hangin' heavy such a routine,
I've just begun to forget
Why I seldom try to break out of their scene.
And now I gotta work on you,
So the frogs will hang and they'll always be hangin'...
Now we're here, what do we do?

I've been sortin' through the pros,
And cons of your eyes, farewell toads.
Can't you help move it along?

And I sure feel rotten long...

I gotta unfry 'fore I pick it up with you.(Help me)
Do I need that stable care?
Don't I know that they'll be there?
Does that count now you've appeared?
Do I need that stable core?
Or do I jump for something more?
Are you all that I fear?

It could be a big mistake.

Eventually you'll split,
Then I won't have to deal.(Sounds like a plan)

Knowin' either way I haven't tried.

"Ever since I was a kid at school
I messed around with all the rules
Apologised then realised
I'm not different after all
Me and the boys thought we had it sussed
Valentinos all of us
My dad said we looked ridiculous
But boy we broke some hearts
In and out of jobs, running free
Waging war with society
Dumb blank faces stare back at me
But nothing ever changed
Promises made in the heat of the night
Creeping home before it got too light
I wasted all that precious time
and blamed it on the wine
I was only joking my dear
Looking for a way to hide my fear
What kind of fool was I
I could never win
Never found a compromise
Collected lovers like butterflies
Illusions of that grand first prize
are slowly wearing thin
Susy baby you were good to me
Giving love unselfishly
But you took it all too seriously
I guess it had to end
I was only joking my dear
Looking for a way to hide my fear
What kind of fool was I
I could never win
Marzing制作
Now you ask me if I'm sincere
That's the question that I always fear
Verse seven is never clear
But I'll tell you what you want to hear
I try to give you all you want
But giving love is not my strongest point
If that's the case it's pointless going on
I'd rather be alone
'Cause what I'm doing must be wrong
Pouring my heart out in a song
Owning up for prosperity
For the whole damn world to see
Quietly now while I turn a page
Act one is over without costume change
The principal would like to leave the stage
The crowd don't understand

We will come reaching, with a song of healing
And they will know us by our love

And my mind out of this jail
There is no clothes that I could buy
That could turn back the time
There is no vacation spot I could fly
That could bring back a piece of real life
Real life, what does it feel like?
I ask you tonight, I ask you tonight
What does it feel like, I ask you tonight
To live a real life
I just want to be a real boy
They always say Kanye, he keeps it real boy
Pinocchio story is, I just want to be a real boy
Pinocchio story is to be a real boy
It′s funny Pinocchio lied and
that′s what kept him from it
I tell the truth and I keep runnin
it′s like I′m looking for something out
there trying to find something
I turn on the tv and see me and see nothing
What does it feel like to live real life to be real?
Not some facade on tv that no can really feel
Do you really have the stamina...
For everybody that sees you and to
say 'where's my camera?'
For everybody that sees you to
say 'sign my autograph'
For everybody that sees you to
say that 'you all that' You all that
I just want to be a real boy,
Pinocchio story goes, I just want to be a real boy
Pinocchio story goes...
And there is no Gepetto to guide
me, no one right beside me
The only one was behind me I can′t find her no more,
I can′t find her no more I can′t...
the only one that come out on the
tour and stay, stay, stay...
Back when I was living at home and
this was all a big dream
And the fame will be got caught
And the day I moved to LA
Maybe that was all my fault
All my fault to be a real boy
Chasing the American dream,
Chasing everything we seen
Up on the tv screen
And when I- the Benz was left
And the clothes was left
And the hoes was left
You talk the hoes to death thinkin the money that the-
You spent the doughs to death
And tell me what-tf for a real boy
They say kanye you keep it too real boy
Perspective and Wise man say, one
day you′ll find your way
The wise man say, you′ll find your way
The wise man say, you′ll find your way
The wise man say

"Did you get my message
The one I left while I was trying to condense everything that I meant
In a minute or less when I called to confess and make all of my stresses go bye-bye

Did you get my message
Didn't, I guess, 'cause if you did you would have called me with your sweet intent
And we could give it a rest instead of beating our breast, making all of the pressure go sky-high

Do you ever wonder what happens to the words that we send
Do they bend, do they break from the flight that they take
And come back together again with a whole new meaning
In a brand new sense, completely unrelated to the one I sent

Did you get my message, ooh
Did you get my message
Did you get my message, yeah, ooh

Uh oh, where did it go
Must have bypassed your phone and flown right outta the window
Oh well, how can I tell
Should I call the operator
Maybe she know the info
But whether or not if my message you got was too much or a lot to reply
Why not try this for a fact
Should you ever come back
I'd relax and be relieved of all my panic attacks

Ah ooh
Did you get my message, ooh
Did you get my message, (Did you now?)
Did you get my message, yeah, ooh

Did you get my message, the one that I left
While I was trying to condense everything that I meant
Now the moment is passed
Not much sand in the glass and I'm standing to lose my mind

Do you ever wonder what happens to the words that we send
Do they bend, do they break from the flight that they take
And come back together again with a whole new meaning
To the matter of our love's defense, and please be sympathetic to the time I spent

Did you get my message, ooh
Did you get my message, (Did you now?)
Did you get my message, yeah, ooh

Did you get my message
No, I didn't hear a word
Did you get my message
Now I'm not gonna believe your lies anymore
Answer the question
I don't hear a thing from you and you keep saying you're coming
Did you get my message now that I wanna get back with you
Did you get my message, love that I wanna reconnect with you
Did you get my message, sugar now
I did not hear one thing you sent to me
Did you get my message, love

Your face is everywhere
I'm reaching out to you
To find that you're not there
I wake up every night
To see the state I'm in
It's like an endless fight
I never seem to win

I can't go on as long as I believe
Can't let go when I keep wondering

Where are you now, what have you found
Where is your heart, when I'm not around
Where are you now, you gotta let me know
Oh baby, so I can let you go

I can hear your voice
The ring of yesterday
It seems so close to me
But yet so far away
I should let it out
To save what's left of me
And close the doors of doubt
Revive my dignity

Bit, I can't go on as long as I believe
Can't let go when I keep wondering

Where are you now, what have you found
Where is your heart, when I'm not around
Where are you now, you gotta let me know
Oh baby, so I can let you go

"The leaves were raked at the end of Edmond Lake
For the teams to find the evidence of why
They had failed to rise and run out and hide
When they heard the voices calling from the flame trees

I could see if the lovers hadn’t been to the lake that day
They could have found a way
To escape to town and take the Greyhound
With the coins we found
We went into the morning light

Won’t you wait, won’t you ever hesitate?
In the leaves you rake at the end of Edmond Lake
You could find that trail of crumbs and details
Of a crime that made us shiver as we climbed back

I could tell how a rabbit and a spell
Could relieve our eyes of plastic apple pies
And the strings that held our covers in well
And the coins we found
We went into the morning light

The leaves were raked at the end of Edmond Lake
For the teams to find the evidence of why
They had failed to rise and run out and hide
When they heard the voices calling from the flame trees

Boyz II Men going off

Never skipped a beat, na, while cooling on South street
Jet black Benz, plenty of friends and all the Philly steaks you can eat

So we started a group and here we are, kickin' it just for you

Hey, ya know what I'm sayin'?

Muthafucka u don't understand
All my rage!
Muthafucka u don't understand
All my pain!
Muthafucka u don't understand...

You seem to sever all my frequencies
I'm tethered to your energies
And everything turns inside out
I can't be killed but I'm not too proud

Maybe you would like to peek through the curtain
At the same mistake you know you always make
But...all I really want to know is
Are you gonna lay the fuck back down
Or jump da fuck up?

Walking in da streets and looking at all this shit
I'm full of hate, don't fuck with me
Walking in da streets and looking at all this shit
Open up your eyes and fucking see
We got the tribe against society
We got to fight the real enemy
Get da fuck up, stand da fuck up
Back da fuck up

All this is making things a bit insane
And I don't care who stares or stays
The only thing that matters is
Will you reach out if you can't resist?

Maybe you don't give a shit for the rest of us
But if you do, the time is now, if it ever was
If you're gonna fight, whatcha gonna do?
Jump da fuck up!

Compare me to your travesties
I only want to see you fight
The darkness you wanna live your life by

Are you gonna give up like a bitch

Smear me in
I don't owe you a goddamn thing
This life has never had the swing
I don't wanna be immortal or legend or anything
Cuz the longer I'm alive, the better off you'll be
Get ready for epitome, come on and pity me...
Will you kill me if I say please?

I'm the same old reasons not to try
What the hell
Beat to death with a shovel and a new smell
Come and get me, mom would never let me do it
I'm ruined, I don't want anything from you
Cuz I've got nothing left to prove, c'mon
My time, everything feels fine, goodbye
Killing from the inside

Every nook, every cranny reorganize,
Realize my face don't fit the way I feel.

In case of upheaval, fundamental movement below,
What's really going on I wanna know,
But yo, it don't show on the outside, so slide.

I need a mirror for my spirit,
Yeah, can you hear it?
When I get deep, wanna hear my soul sleep,
Not drowning, tumbling around and around in the voices
Like a crowd in my head so loud,
I wonder what it's like to be dead,
I hope it's quiet, noise in my head like a riot,
Any remedy you have for me I'll try it.
Just below my skin I'm screaming...

I'm going deep, so deep that I can't sleep,
The pills ain't cheep booze is deep,
So I leak a fifth of booze and a spliff,
Try to snooze,
But whose dream am I in? This is win or lose,
Put down the drink. Try not to think,
Let it go, fundamental movement below,
And yo, reality is dreaming,
Just below my skin I'm screaming...",4

Super lovers, tell me where you got yours (at the super lovers store)
Yoji Yamamoto, I'm hanging with the locals

"On my way to see my friends
who lived a couple blocks away from me (owh)
As I walked through the subway
it must have been about quarter past three
In front of me
stood a beautiful honey with a beautiful body
She asked me for the time
I said it'd cost her her name
a six digit number & a date with me tomorrow at nine
Did she decline? No
Didn't she mind? I don't think so
Was it for real? Damn sure
What was the deal? A pretty girl aged 24
So was she keen? She couldn't wait
Cinnamon queen? let me update
What did she say? She said she'd love to
rendezvous
She asked me what we were gonna do
said we'd start with a bottle of moet for two
Monday
took her for a drink on Tuesday
we were making love by Wednesday
and on Thursday & Friday & Saturday we chilled on Sunday
I met this girl on Monday
took her for a drink on Tuesday
we were making love by Wednesday
and on Thursday & Friday & Saturday we chilled on Sunday
Nine was the time
cos I'll be getting mine
and she was looking fine
Smooth talker
she told me
She'd love to unfold me all night long
Ooh I loved the way she kicked it
from the front to back she flipped
(back she flipped it, ooh the way she kicked it)
And I oh oh I yeah
hope that she'd care
cos I'm a man who'll always be there
Ooh yeah
I'm not a man to play around baby
Ooh yeah
cos a one night stand isn't really fair
From the first impression girl hmm you don't seem to be like that
Cos there's no need to chat for there'll be plenty for that
From the subway to my home
endless ringing of my phone
When you feeling all alone
all you gotta do
is just call me call me

took her for a drink on Tuesday
we were making love by Wednesday

And I ain't about to deny it
It's a special kind thing

We both think the weather’s getting better
So let’s get lucky, let’s go all the way

I found you seaside in the fog
I hadn’t tried a lot of looking for anything at all
The cloud cover of fog

And we both think the weather’s getting better
So let’s get lucky, let’s go all the way

All the way, get lucky
The weatherman says it’s wet and cloudy
Stay indoors, sit out the storm
It looks like this might be a quickie

Hey handsome, we got it good
Hey mister, we gone and done it
Just because we could
Because it’s cloudy out there
Staying in like we should

‘Cause I like your head on my shoulder

"I met God's Will on a Halloween night
He was dressed as a bag of leaves
It hid the braces on his legs at first

His smile was as bright as the August sun
When he looked at me
As he struggled down the driveway, it almost
Made me hurt

Will don't walk too good
Will don't talk too good
He won't do the things that the other kids do,
In our neighborhood

I've been searchin', wonderin', thinkin'
Lost and lookin' all my life
I've been wounded, jaded, loved and hated
I've wrestled wrong and right
He was a boy without a father
And his mother's miracle
I've been readin', writin', prayin', fightin'
I guess I would be still
Yeah, that was until
I knew God's Will

Will's mom had to work two jobs
We'd watch him when she had to work late
And we'd all laugh like I hadn't laughed
Since I don't know when

Hey Jude was his favorite song
At dinner he'd ask to pray
And then he'd pray for everybody in the world but him

Before they moved to California
His mother said, they didn't think he'd live
And she said each day that I have him, well it's just
Another gift
And I never got to tell her, that the boy
Showed me the truth
In crayon red, on notebook paper, he'd written
Me and God love you

I've been searchin', prayin', wounded, jaded
I guess I would be still
Yeah that was until...
I met God's Will on a Halloween night
He was dressed as a bag of leaves",2

Approaching constant failure

Between love and hate
Which path to follow?
How can I keep balance in this race?
Come faith, I'm dying slowly

In many ways I'm the burden

That divides us from the light

In many ways you're the halo
That keeps my spirit alive

Temptation, if you could reave a part

In me you evoke the dark away

Now free me and watch me heal

Tell me which side I'm on

Approaching constant failure

Between love and hate
Which path to follow?

How can I keep balance in this race?
Come faith, I'm dying
Bemused by the trials and tribulations in force of my life
Fly from here but as the chosen pessimist

Carve my name in stone

Carve my name in stone

"I wanna tell you a little story about a party that went all right but went all wrong
I wanna tell you a little story about a party in this song...

It happened back in '93, in the PITTSBURG PUNK ROCK SCENE
An event that will go down, in infamy
It was all the masterplan, of one legendary PUNK ROCK KID
His name was ""Spaz"", S-P-A-Z

An eviction notice to his house sparked off an idea
""I should have one last party at my place...""
So off he set with his master plan, the invitation in his hand read:
""You're invited to my House Destruction Party!""

Spaz's House Destruction Party, it was chaos with no end
If you were crazy enough to make the House Destruction Party then you know
You're lucky that you lived

Let's go!

We played there St. Patrick's Day with Submachine and THE BAD GENES
In a basement full of debris
From kicked in doors, broken glass, knocked in walls, THE PLACE WAS THRASHED
The house was now missing it's support beams

The bathrooms had no toilets or sinks left in them
There was nothing in the kitchen left to break
Aus Rotten spray painted on the walls, drunk punks passed out in the halls
And this was just the second night of the three-day long party

Spaz's House Destruction Party, it was chaos with no end
If you were crazy enough to make the House Destruction Party then you know
You're lucky that you lived

The cops showed up and all the kids went piling out the back
I remember running away and hiding out in the lot behind the Squirrel Hill Mellon Bank
The cop said, ""I wanna speak to someone who lives here!"" and this punk kid said she did
He asked, ""Is this the condition the house has always been in?""
She answered, ""Uh... yeah, it is.""

Spaz's House Destruction Party, it was chaos with no end
If you were crazy enough to make the House Destruction Party then you know
You're lucky that you lived

Let's go! hey...",1

And sit and nurse my broken heart

I may be skinny at times but I'm fat fulla rhymes
Pass me the mic and I'm a grab at it
Well isn't it delicious crazy way that I'm kissin'
This baby listen to this
don't wanna miss it while it's hittin'
Sometimes you gotta fit in to get in
But don't ever quit
cause soon I'm gonna let you in but see
I don't care what you might think about me
You can vibe without me if you want
I could be the one to take you home
Baby we could rock the night alone
If we never get down it wouldn't be a let down
But sugar don't forget what you already know
That I could be the one to turn you on
We could be the talk across the town
Don't judge me by the color, confuse it for another
You might regret what you let slip away
Like the geek in the pink
I'm the geek in the pink yeah

Well this relationship fodder don't mean to bother nobody
But Cupid's automatic musta fired multiple shots at her
Because she fall in love too often that's what the matter
At least I talk about it keep a pattern of flattery and
She was starin' through the doorframe
Eyeing me down like already a bad boyfriend
Well she can get her toys outta the drawer then
Cause I ain't comin' home
I don't need that attention, see
I don't care what she might think about me

Hey baby look at me go
From zero to hero
You better take it from a geek like me
Well I can save you from unoriginal dum dums
Who wouldn't care if you com...plete him or not

So what I've got a short attention span
A coke in my hand
Because I'd rather have the afternoon,
relax and understand
My hip hop and flip flops
it don't stop with the light rock
A shot to mock you kinda puts me in the tight spot
The hype is nothing more than hoo ha so I'm
Developing a language and I'm callin' it my own
So take a peek into the speaker and you'll see what I mean
That on the other side the grass is greener
I don't care what you might think about me
You'll get by without me if you want
I could be the one to take you home
Baby we could rock the night alone
If we never get down it wouldn't be the let down
But sugar don't forget what you already know

"Such a crime
I don't remember being taken
This love was meant for
Wandering eyes and fakin'

So hot the way you looking
And when he's on it, man
he's running and he's booking

in the beginning
But you got me so wet
And then you left me swimming
Keep it coming with the
love I can't resist
I'm so tired but don't
you dare quit
'Cause it's a lie, it's a crime
and it's just something
That I can't deny but

You know it looks so
good from the outside

It's a mistake that I'm
willing to make
And a promise that I just
might break but
Gotta find out how much
my heart can take

From the moment I met you
I knew this love was
bound to get you

you're weak that way

Looking out the window
and it's only the beginning
People are talking
And my ears start ringing
But I don't care what they say

'Cause they'll never know
me anyway

'Cause it's a lie, it's a crime
and it's just something
That I can't deny but
You know it looks so
good from the outside

It's a mistake that I'm
willing to make
And a promise that I just
might break
Gotta find out how much
my heart can take  take
take
And I know what he wants
And I know what he needs
I got the type of love
That's gonna bring you
right down to your knees

Bring you right down to
your knees

I'm begging you oh please

I want to be the lover
For your cover

How could you deny

This love so great
Love so grand
If you don't understand
That this love will take
you make you
It'll mess you maybe break you
But it'll leave you stronger
in the end
And I guess it all depends
'Cause it's a lie, it's a crime,
and it's just something
that I can't deny
You know it looks so
good from the outside

It's a mistake that I'm
willing to make

"Deep Green Dark Chaos
Blinded I run down these paths
By heart I know them
They lead to the soaring cliffs
Stout they stand above the water's edge
Lifeless

And this is my foundation
Cold stone
Formed only by winds and time
How invulnerable
Lifeless

Ah...
I have longed to be at one with this
Yet, the waters call my name

For once I wish to see
The entity behind the voice
The face of this seduction
The beauty of my pain

Am I blessed or am I cursed by thy presence?
What is my crime?
What is my deed?
Is this life my redemption?
Shall I repent or proceed?

I hate my flesh
Its dimension poisoned my soul with doubt
It made me question the essence of...
The 'I'

Slaves are those of this world
Given freedom to lay the chains upon The Master
The wolf is no longer free
Release the chains and come for me

Suddenly, his mournful cries were stunned.
Out of the cold mist came three enthralling ships.
Sails torn by many a storm, and the bows adorned by the
Most fierce gargoyles he'd ever laid eyes upon. Yet, the
Crew they bore... Three times twelve in numbers. They
Stood motionless, wrapped in grey, worn gowns.
And from behind their shadowed faces the seductive chanting.
Bidding him on board. without hesitation, he accepted.
And away they sailed...

Upon these seas
Wherein I drowned so many times
I scatter the ashes of destiny
Still my flame is in hunger

With fire in my heart
Shall I greet the shores ahead
Though, I know not what will burn...

Desire...

Ah...
In the distance
I hear the waves wash over solid ground
And in this moment I am struck blind

Grant me sight so I can see
That which lies ahead of me
Cursed be my mortal eyes
For dying in this realm of death

Hear my call...

I return to the soaring cliffs
They truly shine of strength
Even though I nothing learned
With strength I burn...",2

gripping your pillow tight

When you said goodbye, my whole world shines
Hey hey hey

If I’m drinking, then I’m buying
And I know there’s no denying
It’s a beautiful day, the sun is up, the music’s playing
And even if it started raining
You won’t hear this boy complaining
‘Cause I’m glad that you’re the one that got away
It’s a beautiful day

It’s my turn to fly, so girls, get in line
‘Cause I’m easy, no playing this guy like a fool
Now I’m alright
Might’ve had me caged before, but not tonight

‘Cause you may not believe
That baby, I’m relieved
This fire inside, it burns too bright
I don’t want to say “so long”,
 I just want to say “goodbye”

My time with thinking of our break-up
Then, you’ve got another thing coming your way

But I never thought it got that bad
It's only love that's been changed
But I never thought you'd light the match
I need you every time that I'm alone

"Born to multiply, born to gaze into night skies,
All you want’s one more Saturday.
But look here, until then
They’re gonna buy your nice time
So keep your wick in the air and your feet in the fetters
To the day.
You come in doing cartwheels
We all go out by ourselves
And your shape on the dance floor
Will have me thinking such filth and gauge my eyes.
You’d be damned to be one of us girl
Faced with a dodo’s conundrum
Ah, I felt like I could just fly
But nothing’ll happen every time I try.
A dual tone under wall
Selfish fool and hoped you’d save us all
Never dreamt of such sterile hands,
You keep them folded in your lap,
And raise them up to beg for scraps,
You know, he's holding you down,
With the tips of his fingers just the same,
You'll be pulled from the ocean,
But just a minute too late,
Or changed by a potion,
We’ll find a handsome young mate,
For you to love.
You'll be damned to pining through the windowpanes,
You know you'll change your life for any ordinary Joe,
And though your night will go on,
Your nightmares only need a year or two to unfold.

Been in love since you were twenty-one,
You haven't laughed since January,
You try and make this up this is so much fun,
But we know it to be quite contrary.
Dare to be one of us, girl,
Facing the Andrum's conundrum,
Ah, I feel like I should just cry,
But nothing happens every time I take one on the chin,
You’re humoring your cote,
You don't know how long I've been,
Watching the lantern dim,
Starved of oxygen,
So give me your hand,
And let's jump out the window.

Ass stinging no breath legs clinging to the bedside

Hard pressed just to get a little rest every night
Same shit can't remember last time that I slept right

Landlords and tenants, got served by creditors

"Boys and girls, wanna hear a true story?
Saturday night was at this real wild party
They had the liquor overflowing the cup
About five, six strippers trying to work for a buck

And I took one girl outside with me
Her name was Lila, she went to junior high with me
I said: ""Why you up in there dancing for cash?
I guess a whole lot has changed since I've seen you last"", she said

(What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor?
'Cause he's hungry and the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money)

(And his daddy's gone, somewhere smoking rock now
In and out of lock down, I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time
But for me this is what I call life, mmm)

Girl, you ain't the only one with a baby
But that's no excuse to be living all crazy
Then she looked me right square in the eye
And said: ""Everyday I wake up hoping to die""

She said: ""Nigga, I know about pain 'cause
Me and my sister ran away so my daddy couldn't rape us
Before I was a teenager
I'd done been through more shit you can't even relate to""

(What would you do?)
'Cause I wouldn't want my baby to go through what I went through

I kept it for a week to see how long he last
He stared right back of me
He thought that he could win
We played the waiting game
He thought that I give in

I had a dream last night, that I was drunk
I killed the stranger, and left him in a trunk
In Brighton railway station
It was an unsolved case
A famous murder mystery
People love mystery
England made me
England made me
England made me
England made me
I need my privacy, I lead a secret life
Sleep with the enemy, and betray both sides
I travelled all my life, but never got away
From the killing jar, and it got me sick

I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now it's a still night in my wind pipe
I can't breathe but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight
High off the law, drunk from my hate,
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fucking hates me and I love it.

No you ain't. Come back we're running right back.

When you're with 'em
You meet and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feeling
Yeah, them those chills you used to get 'em
Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at him
You swore you'd never hit him; never do nothing to hurt him
Now you're in each other's face spewing venom in your words when you spit them
You push pull each other's hair, scratch claw hit him
Throw him down pin him
So lost in the moments when you're in them
It's a race that's the culprit controls your boat
So they say you're best to go your separate ways
Guess if they don't know you cus today that was yesterday
Yesterday is over it's a different day
Sound like broken records playing over but you promised her
Next time you show restraint
You don't get another chance
Life is no Nintendo game
But you ?? the game
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
I guess that's why they call it window pain
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie

Now I know he said things hit things that we didn't mean
And we fall back into the same patterns same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is
You're the same as me
But when it comes to love you're just as blinded
Baby, please come back
It wasn't you, baby it was me
Maybe our relationship wasn't as crazy as it seemed
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk
I told you this is my fault
Look me in the eye ball
Next time I'm pissed, I lay my fist at the drywall
Next time. There won't be no next time
I apologize even though I know its lies
I'm tired of the games I just want her back
I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fucking leave again
Im'a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie

"Your voice is adrift, I can't expect it
To sing to me
As if I was the only one

I'll follow you
The leaf that's following the sun
When will my weight be too much for you?
When will these ideas really be my own?
Cause this moment keeps on moving
We were never meant to hold on

This was a scene worth waking up for
When I woke up
You planted me in my own body
Don't know why
But somehow it just feels so wrong

When you said I will be lonely
But when you rise again I'll have become the sun
And I will shine down upon you
As if you were the only one

Your voice is your own, I can't protect it
You'll have to sing
A verse no one has ever known

Don't be afraid
Cause no one ever sings alone
Your weight will never be too much for me
Your ideas have always been your own
This moment keeps on moving
We were never meant to hold on",4

Grateful for everything I have
And I know I should be less downfall
But unfortunately I am just human

But where should I go?
If Earth's the only place I know
All I know is I don't want this anymore
Living a life without knowing what it is that I'm searching searching for

There are days where I would love to be somebody else
Days where I am fighting myself
There are days where I wish I would be a child again
And sometimes days where I wish they wouldn't last
Days where I wish I would be dead

Step back, stay away from me
Can't you respect that I only need my peace
These days I'm too weak to see
These days are all about me
I don't want to talk things out

Cause there are certain things we don't need to talk about
The silence in between will let you know what I mean
And each time I try to escape
I pray to God not to let me fail
And to take my doubts away

Here we go yo, here we go yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario

Ayo, Bo knows this (what) and Bo knows that (what)
But Bo don't know jack, cause Bo can't rap
Well what do you know, the Di-Dawg is first up to bat
No batteries included, and no strings attached
No holds barred, no time for move faking
Gots to get the loot so I can bring home the bacon
Brothers front, they say the Tribe can't flow
But we've been known to do the impossible like Broadway Joe so
Sleep if you want, NyQuil will help you get your Z's, troop
But here's the real scoop
I'm all that and then some, short, dark and handsome
Bust a nut inside your eye to show you where I come from
I'm vexed, fuming, I've had it up to here
My days of paying dues are over, acknowledge me as in there (yeah)
Head for the border, go get a taco
Watch me wreck it from the jump street, meaning from the get-go
Sit back, relax and let yourself go
Don't front what you heard, but act like you know

Yes yes, y'all (yes y'all)
Who got the vibe, it's the Tribe y'all (Tribe y'all)
Real live, y'all (live y'all)
Inside, outside, come around
(Who's that) Brown
Some may, I say, call me Charlie
The word is the herb and I'm deep like Bob Marley
Lay back on the payback, evolve, rotate the gates
(Contact) Can I get a hit (hit)
Boom bip with a brother named Tip, and we're ready to flip
East coast stomping, ripping and romping
New York, North Cak-a-laka, and Compton
Checka-checka-check it out
The loops for the troops, more bounce to the ounce
And wow how now wow how now, Brown cow
We're ill till the skill gets down
For the flex, next, it's the textbook old to the new
But the rest are doo-doo
From radio to the video to Arsenio
Tell me, yo, what's the scenario

(True blue) Scooby Doo, whoopie doo
Scenarios, radios, rates more than four
Scores for the smores that smother dance floors
Now I go for mine, shades of seashore
Ship-shape crushed grapes, apes that play tapes
Papes make drakes, baked for the wakes
Of an L-ah, and -eader, simply just a leader
Bass in the space means ""peace, see ya later""
Later (later), later alligator
Pop blows the weasel and the herb's the inflator
So yo, the D what the O, incorporate I-N-C into a flow
Funk flipped flat back first this foul fight fight fight
Laugh yo, how'd that sound (ooh)

It's a Leader Quest mission and we got the goods here (here)
Never on the left cause my right's my good ear (ear)
I could give a damn about a ill subliminal
Stay away from crime so I ain't no criminal
I love my young nation, groovy sensation
No time for hibernation, only elation
Don't ever try to test the water, little kid
Yo Mr. Busta Rhymes, tell 'em what I did

I heard you rushed and rushed, and attacked
Then they rebuked, then you had to smack
Causing rambunction throughout the sphere
Raise the levels of the boom inside the ear

You know I did it
So don't violate or you'll get violated
The hip-hop sound is well agitated
Won't ever waste no time on the played out ego
So here's Busta Rhymes with the scenario

Watch as I combine all the juice from the mind
Heel up, wheel up, bring it back, come rewind
Powerful impact (boom) from the cannon
Not bragging, try to read my mind, just imagine
Vocabulary's necessary
When digging into my library
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh
Eating Ital Stew like the one Peter Tosh
Uh, uh, uh, all over the track, man
Uh, pardon me, uh, as I come back
As I did it, yo I heard you beg your pardon
When I travel through the town, I roll with the squadron
Roar, roar, like a dungeon dragon
Change your little drawers cause your pants are sagging
Try to step to this, I will twist you in a turban
And have you smelling ripe like some old stale urine
Chickity-choco, the chocolate chicken
The rear cock diesel, butt cheeks they were kicking
Yo, bust it out before the Busta bust another rhyme
The rhythm is in sync (uh) the rhymes are on time (time)
Ripping up this dance just like Horatio
Observe the vibe and check out the scenario
Yeah, my man, motherafucka

Here we go yo, here we go yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario
Here we go yo, here we go yo

Of visual relevancy 
Frame-lines tell me what to see 
Chopping like an axe
Or maybe Eisenstein should just relax 

Slow down everyone 
You're moving too fast 
Frames can't catch you when 
You're moving like that 

Well Plato's cave is full of freaks 
Demanding refunds for the things they've seen 
I wish they could believe
In all the things that never made the screen
And just slow down everyone
You're moving too fast 
Frames can't catch you when 
You're moving like that 
Slow down everyone 
You're moving too fast 
Frames can't catch you when you're moving like that
Moving too fast",4

"Do they not have pen or paper where you are?
Because I haven't heard from you in ages
I relive each memory from time to time
Read notes exchanged
With all those scented pages
It's coming back, it's all coming back to me now

Tell me everything turned out alright
Because I'm where we said
That we'd meet tonight
Does he treat you like you want?
Does he ask to take your hand?
Does he believe in dreams we talked about?
When with no music we danced
I thought you said that you'd come find me
I thought you said you'd be home by now
I heard you sang that you'd come back here
So I wrote to remind you to somehow

Dance by yourself and think of me when you do
I'm not sure you understand
what this means to me, what you do to me
But I'm willing to prove
That you're the one
I regret to slip away
Now I know it was only you
that I've been searching for
Been missing all this time
I thought you said that you'd come find me
I thought you said you'd be home by now
I heard you sang that you'd come back here
So I wrote to remind you to somehow
I thought you said that you'd come find me
I thought you said you'd be home by now
I heard you sang that you'd come back here
So I wrote to remind you to somehow

Let the past be past
Let's start today
Letters won't do
I need to see your face
Tell me where to meet
And I'll tell you why we should be

I thought you said that you'd come find me
I thought you said you'd be home by now
I heard you sang that you'd come back here
So I wrote to remind you to somehow

"You and me between the sheets
It just doesn’t get better than this
The many windswept yellow stickies of my mind
Are the molten emotional front line
I couldn’t care less
I’m transfixed in this absolute bliss

Sweet sleepless, tumbling night
Oh, and the morning on the your skin
and loved up light
Tracing patterns in the maze of your back
Softly, softly the goose bumps like that
And then a kiss…

Maybe another,
and another one

"If this life is one act
Why do we lay all these traps
We put them right in our path
When we just wanna be free

I will not waste my days
Making up all kinds of ways
To worry about some things
That will not happen to me

So I just let go of what I know I don't know
And I know I'll only do this by
Living in the moment
Living our life
Easy and breezy
With peace in my mind
With peace in my heart
Peace in my soul
Wherever I'm going, I'm already home
Living in the moment

I'm letting myself off the hook for things I've done
I let my past go past
And now I'm having more fun
I'm letting go of the thoughts
That do not make me strong
And I believe this way can be the same for everyone

And if I fall asleep
I know you'll be the one who'll always remind me
To live in the moment
To live my life
Easy and breezy
With peace in my mind
I got peace in my heart
Got peace in my soul
Wherever I'm going, I'm already home

I can't walk through life facing backwards
I have tried
I tried more than once to just make sure
And I was denied the future I'd been searching for
But I spun around and searched no more
By living in the moment
Living my life
Easy and breezy
With peace in my mind
I got peace in my heart
Got peace in my soul
Wherever I'm going, I'm already home

I'm living in the moment
I'm living my life
Just taking it easy
With peace in my mind
I got peace in my heart
I got peace in my soul
 wherever I'm going, I'm already home
I'm living in the moment
I'm living my life
 easy and breezy
With peace in my mind
I got peace in my heart
I got peace in my soul

I wonder how innocent she was,
when I saw how she transformed herself in no time.
the one who used to say we'll never be get separated,
said goodbye in no time.
There was me, her, and many evenings,
there were many moons lighting the sky.

why she got upset with me in no time.

Enforcing their truth through a gun

Aggressive discipline and barbaric control

"Yesterday I died, tomorrow's bleeding,
Fall into your sunlight.
The future's open wide beyond believing,
To know why hope dies.
Losing what was found, a world so hollow,
Suspended in a compromise.
The silence of this sound is soon to follow,
Somehow sundown.

And finding answers is forgetting,
All of the questions we call home,
Passing the graves of the unknown.

Reason clouds my eyes, with splendor fading.
Illusions of the sunlight.
A reflection of a lie will keep me waiting.
With love gone for so long.

And this day's ending is the proof of time killing all the faith I know.
Knowing that faith is all that I hold.

Yesterday I died, tomorrow's bleeding.
Fall into your sunlight.

"Lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
I have nobody for my own
I'm so lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
I have nobody for my own
I am so lonely 

Yo, this one here goes out to all my players out there, man
Ya know, that got that one good girl, Lord
That's always been there
Like took all the bullshit
Then one day she can't take it no more and decide to leave

Yeah, I woke up in the middle of the night
And I noticed my girl wasn't by my side
Coulda sworn I was dreamin' for her
I was feenin' so I had to take a little ride

Backtracking over these few years
Tryin' ta figure out what I do to make it go bad
'Cause ever since my girl left me
My whole life came crashing and I'm so...

I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own girl)

I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own girl)
I am so lonely

Can't believe I had a girl like you
And I just let you walk right outta my life
After all I put you through 
You still stuck around and stayed by my side

What really hurt me is I broke your heart
Baby you're a good girl and I had no right
I really wanna make things right
'Cause without you in my life girl I'm so...

I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own girl)

I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own girl)
I am so lonely

Been all about the world, ain't never met a girl 
That can take the things that you been through
Never thought the day would come where you'd get up and run 
And I would be out chasing you

'Cause ain't nowhere in the globe I'd rather be
Ain't no one in the globe I'd rather see 
Than the girl of my dreams that made me be
So happy but now so lonely...

I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own girl)

I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own girl)
I am so lonely

Never thought that I'd be alone (be alone)
I didn't think you'd be gone this long (gone so long)
I just want you to call my phone
So stop playing girl and come on home (come on home)

Baby girl I didn't mean to shout
I want me and you to work it out (work it out baby)
I had never wished to ever hurt my baby (hurt my baby)
And it's drivin' me crazy 'cause I'm so...

I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own girl)

I'm so lonely (so lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely (Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody (I have nobody)
For my own (to call my own girl)
I am so lonely

So lonely (lonely)
So lonely (so lonely)
Mr. Lonely (lonely)
So lonely (so lonely)

So lonely (lonely)
So lonely (so lonely)
So lonely

"Sit here waiting by the bathroom door 
Hoping I might see a little more 
Sick of love stains on my sheets 
Sick of love stars I don't want to keep 

Look in my mind's eye 
Look into my mind's eye 

What do I know? 
And you? 
What do I know? 

And I don't know if I'm wrong or right 
And I don't know where I'll sleep tonight 
Sick of love stains on my sheets 
Sick of love stars I don't want to keep 

Look in my mind's eye 
Look into my mind's eye 

What do I know? 
And you? 
What do I know? 
What do I know? 

Winter came today and took the sun away 
What do I know? 
Who were you to be 
It's all the same to me 
What do I know? 
What do I know? 

And I can't tell you anything 
And I can't tell you anything 
And I can't tell you anything 
And I can't tell you anything 
And I can't tell you anything 
And I can't tell you anything 

Maybe you'll make it home 
You make it home",2

"Homeboys take time and elevate your mind
We came to rock the spot, rock the spot
Homegirls inside just let your nature rise
We came to rock the spot, rock the spot

Now Gabby got the verbal that'll get your little wifey out her girdle
In a session with me lightin' up a little herbal
Turtle shell
School individuals that listen to me
Word it well
Given to the rapper who is livin' to be heard and held
In a high esteem
I get you drunker than your bourbon, ale, liquor, malt, my assault learned it well
Turn the tables of time with my perception
Building staples of rhyme hear my reflections
""On a little"" life I'm livin' in a universe with no beginning to it
So it ain't an ending and at times I get to diggin into infinite subliminably spirited
A nigga with a ""clip and send it rip""
Indigenous stork has just touched ground
Rappers organizations get shut down
Not that I don't wanna see my brothers succeed
But rap it's like a sport, I dominate, so follow my lead
I be the G-I-F-T test me hefty left's be gettin' swung
Cruise like a jet ski
Up in yo apartment and plop on your couch y'all
Undisputed heavyweight lyrical southpaw

It's like a lime to a lemon-that rhymes, I assemble them
At times when I'm "" "" they shine you remember
"" "" Divine forces "" "" that refine men and women &amp;
I rhyme for a livin', not just for the scrilla man
That isn't what it's all about, really now, valid clout
Uzi MC's I have arguments 'n' fallin' outs wit'
About what it's all about, ain't about foamin out the mouth
Like a walkin' tall can of Guinness Stout
"" ""
When the battle cries soundin'
Ding-ding, hit 'em like, bing-bing
Eat 'em like, B-King, yet wit' no seasoning-bee sting
Wich yo girl dressed in a g-string she's swingin'
My way shorty and it sure looks good
I'm cookin up a batch of dopeness like a good cook should
I be the jack of trades, rappers pray
That I don't decapitate, after they cash his ass
Is that an irate? Great!
Grade-A, top-choice lyricism
Hey, hit me wit' that shell shocked rhythm
One time fo' the funky rhymes I say
Two times for the beat and for my DJ
It don't stop

I say we drop it on a (one), we drop it on a (two)
We comin' out (fresh), and we do it (for you)
You know the deal with Blackalicious, we don't play
(From New York, NY) (to streets of LA) to (??)
You know we leave the party wreakin' a disaster
For the new ""millie"", rain like a shower
Let it seep in your pores (??)
Oh lord that's [scratch]
Rock ya from the top and to the bottom (from the bottom to the top)
('Cause I grab the mic) wit the intent to get ill
A natural that you know who is (still Mrs. Field's)
So slide to the side and (take it light) and (throw your hands in the air) all night (party people in the place...)
I make 'em suffer, to the fallen MC's I'd be the (quicker pickem upper) (galactic of a nebula)
I'm rappin' the spectacular, attackin whack amateurs 'n' back stabbin salamanders
Creepin' while I'm peepin on 'em (party time)
Before I used to hit the meetings it was (Thunderbird wine) (used to drink the Ole)
Now I drink Calistoga, sober and I'm older
But the world is still gettin' colder (colder)

"You must have been phlegmatic in stature
The gates of Thanos are a spread eagle wide
You let the shutters make sackcloth and ashes
Out of a blind man's picaresque heart

You take the veil, you'll take the dive
You take the veil

It's not over till the tremulant sings
These ides of march, are they so make believe?
How tempts the revenant
Slice up and not across

You take the veil, you'll take the dive
You take the veil

A mass of gallon sloth (They are gonna get you)
As flies have walls for feet
A rapturous verbatim (You better run), someone said but who's to know?
And when you find the fringe (They won't let you)
The one last hit that spent you
You'll find the ossuary (You better fight) spilling by the day

Iconoclastic had it coming for years
They know the prisons that you have yet to fear
Where thumbs hide inside of sleeping bag mouths
Adlib your memories by casting a drought

You take the veil, you'll take the dive
You take the veil

A mass of gallon sloth (They are gonna get you)
As flies have walls for feet
A rapturous verbatim (You better run), someone said but who's to know?
And when you find the fringe (They won't let you)

Talking in its sleep again
Knife me in, hobbling
Talking in its sleep again

Knife me in, hobbling
Talking in its sleep again
Knife me in, hobbling

Virulent hives of bedpost piles
Virulent hives, revenant herds

Who turned it off?
The last thing I remember now

Forsaken depraved and wrought with fear

"You go with your two feet bare
Down through the cold lane there to Brighton
A country house, a liar and a louse live there

And go with your arms held wide
Happiness in your eyes, come and sit
And stay the night, turn out every light you see
And lay them down, buried in the ground for me

Oh, my love
Oh, my love
Oh, my love
Oh, my love

The tongues of the creatures wait
Drawn to the fragile legs you walk on
A cold wind blows, Brighton to the coast for me

Now it seems life's passed me by, I'm still alone today
Here come the tears

Looks like it'll always be the same
No one here to comfort me
Here come the tears

All alone, no one cares
So much to give to you all out there

Take me now, in your arms
Let me rest, safe from harm

Ohhh.... I want to be loved
I need to be loved
Won't somebody love me

I don't care about money
It doesn't give me half the thrill
To the thought of you honey
So tell me if you want me still

I can't make you love me

I can't make you love me
I'm just a girl with a crush on you, baby

Alright, yeah, yeah, yeah...

Just the thought of being close to you
It's incomparable

And the things I do, seems like I have it all

Can't make you, make you love me baby

Can't make you love me

"Arrived we to the days ov our beginning
To the City ov God clothed with the mists
Enslaved by life we danced spinning
In the taverns of time we used to sit
And drunk with memories
Dead moments glorified

I saw the phantoms ov Golgotha
Legion Legion
Fed on dust ov dead
Anoited by the grey ash
Mad, twisted mob ov Jerusalem

Then Raphael beyond me and night appear'd
Bent and The Word was announc'd

An archangelic grreting (Jetzirah! Jetzirah!)
The sign ov Portal, reality ov nature
Not to be, but to become
In aimless wandering across the time

On the sea ov possibilities untouched I stood
From my hand cracked heaven idols are falling to the pieces
Reached the horizon
Dagger in the air
Sylphs work is done
Oracles ov past aeons fulfill'd

Live we on the edge ov the worlds
In titanic turn ov time
Here and beyond
Carried on the wings ov the sun
Infinite, sacred power we call
And sight hardly can catch the moment ov eternity
When drink with light
In light we will live

And in the formless rapture
Will we sing psalm ov Might
The last spell ov Will:
""We are one
We are none!""",2
"It's not her fault that she's so irresistible
But all the damage she's caused is unfixable
Every twenty seconds you repeat her name
But when it comes to me you don't care
If I'm alive or dead

Objection I don't wanna be the exception
To get a bit of your attention
I love you for free and I'm not your mother
But you don't even bother
Objection I'm tired of this triangle
Got dizzy dancing tango
I'm falling apart in your hands again
No way I've got to get away

Next to her cheap silicone I look minimal
That's why in front of your eyes I'm invisible
But you gotta know small things also count
You better put your feet on the ground
And see what it's about

So objection, I don't want to be the exception
To get a bit of your attention
I love you for free and I'm not your mother
But you don't even bother
Objection the angles of this triangle
Got dizzy dancing tango
I'm falling apart in your hands again
No way, no no no no

I wish there was a chance for you and me
I wish you couldn't find a place to be
Away from here...

This is pathetic and sardonic
It's sadistic and psychotic
Tango is not for three
Was never meant to be
But you can try it
Rehearse it
Or train like a horse
But don't you count on me
Oh don't you count on me boy

Objection I don't want to be the exception
To get a bit of your attention
I love you for free and I'm not your mother
But you don't even bother
Objection I'm tired of this triangle
Got dizzy dancing tango
I'm falling apart in your hands again
No way I've got to get away

Get away... get away hey hey hey get away
Uh huh uh huh hoo
Uh huh uh huh... Uh huh ooh
Oh I'm falling apart in Your hands again
Get away hey hey hey
I'm falling apart in your hands again
Get away... Get away",1
"My tragedy's different
My life's deep, listen,
Gotta bail, I'm limpin
Walked outta hell's kitchen
Why bother cherishin'
My past is everything, wrong, and my arrogance
Walk down the stairs pissin'
Cop us 'cause they're bitchin'
Life isn't fair, singin'
Blues and my rap drippin'
Ooze out the blood sinkin
Deep down to earth thinking
Leave out a nerp chicken
I should run, forfeit, and everything I know listen!

I was the misdirected
I was the least expected
Hop on and get rejected
Walk on and feel neglected
I feel like I'm the message
Unheard but I'm the message
I'm the last prolific remaining offer from the gutter

Shot was my girlfriend
When we was younger
Her I was scarred yo
Bullets I survived though
Death it's came easy
Truth the games needs me
Never let them see me down, smile while I'm bleeding

Smile when your struggling
Smile when you're in jail
Smile when your dead broke
Smile and the rents due
Smile you ain't got friends now
Smile and no one knows you
Never let them see you down smile while you bleeding
Smile when he leaves you
Smile cause girl he needs you
Smile plenty single mothers cry the tears you do
Smile despite the war
Smile despite the pain yo
Never let them see you down smile while you bleeding

To my man Kareem in prison
I can't speak your name
It hurt me that you never listened
It can't be the same
I had to grow my intuition
Had me deep in pain
'Cause I knew my options were either broke or the prison chains
I can't do it
I can't see it, look
Dammit, I can't blow it
I got a judge telling me my life's key
They will throw it
No sir
I plan to have a chauffeur
It seems to me this chopping crack is really going no where

Therefore
I'm resurrected
They call me
The poor injection
I infect you with the real
The dustyfeetphilosahectagos
I spit, so sick
I skid out
I'm fallin'
I'm shit outta luck and I'm trapped but I'll get out

Can you help me
I'm going crazy
My mom plays trix and I beat on the floor like bush wick
My fists bloody and blistered
A pair like I'm ballistic
I just stare at the red and smile while I'm bleeding

There are a few things you gotta take into account
I'm not an entertainer I've never been a clown
I was born where the mothers give birth while they frown
I would walk with the kids that would bra sound ah
Never really thought I'd make it to fourteen
And anybody wanted to fight I was most keen
Plus I had a little temper it was often foreseen
Yo say something bout my momma id shoot ya dead out clean
But ya gotta keep in mind that I grew up Mogadishu (tell em)
The only law was gun law
And we don't walk with a pistol
You get laughed at for being so insensitive to the environment
Cause how will you be heard when those big boys are firin'
War is no place for a child
Especially if hes rollin' with an ak and a smile
He had witnesses on mother bloody in a towel
But please, please, please, please
But never let 'em see you down smile while you bleedin'",1
"I got lost, couldn't find my way
And I guess there's nothing more to say
Love can make you blind, make you act so strange
But I'm here and here I will stay

So everyday I cry (everyday...)
Yes everyday I fall (everyday...)
Do you ever wonder why (everyday...)
Why I love everything about you

But everyday I say I'll try
To make my heart be still
Till then every way there is to cry
Ourselves to sleep we will

It picked me up, knocked me off my feet
I've got no way to explain
Still I love you, love you, love you but this fire inside
Will never see the light of day

So everyday goes by (everyday...)
And everyday I fall (everyday...)
It makes me wonder why (everyday...)
My life's worth nothing without you

But everyday I say I'll try
To make my heart be still
'Cause every way there is to cry,
Ourselves to sleep, we will

You'll never know, no, no, no, no, no
You'll never know just how close we were
You'll never know, no, no, no, no, no
You'll never know
No you'll never see

The book closes and we try to forget
But I know that things won't change
How we feel, how life goes on
And that seems so strange

And so the light fades away (everyday...)
Try, try, try as I may (everyday...)
I can't stop thinking about you
It seems my life's worth nothing without you

But everyday I say I'll try
To make my heart be still
Till then every way there is to cry,
Ourselves to sleep, we will

Everyday, everyday you know I try so hard
Everyday, everyday it gets a little harder

"Yo, yeah girl,
Can you hear that? It's playing our song..
Are you sleepy? Take a nap..
You're not afraid of the dark? Are you.?

You hear the beat as it makes ya not wanna go to sleep
I knock on Dakota's door, its locked so I go to creep
round the back, with binoculars, not cause I wanna peep
But because I'm hungry she smells like tacos I wanna eat
Visions of hot chocolatey marshmallows all so sweet
With sugar plums, oh look here comes Marshall he's on your street
He's placing hot smoldering charcoals beneath your feet
Now walk on 'em, he's dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek
Like a Thanksgiving turkey, or holiday ham
Cinnamon sprinkled on toast, strawberry marmalade jam
Flavor my favorite graham crackers with John Bennet Rams
I guess a modern day Jack the Ripper is all that I am

Cos when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep (My music box)
But I can hear my luck keep calling me (My music box)
When were worlds apart, you mean the world to me (My music box)
? I will answer (My music box)

Cos when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep (My music box)
I hear my music box, playing a song for me (My music box)
So when she twirls around do a whirl for me (My music box)
? (My music box)

I almost look comatose, who wants to be sober gross
I foam like a Doberman, mouth open I overdose
Put coke up my nostrils, in both my holes and I plug my nose
My pupils quadruple in size, eyes are so bugged I know
I put on my mother's make up, get naked and run around
Wavin' the gun around, I think I’m down to a hundred pounds
There's thunder, I wonder how come it rains but the sun is out
The devils upset with his wife, they must be sluggin' it out
I must be buggin' the f-ck out, but what the f-ck about?
Voices are leading me up to the attic, I love my house
They pull and they tug my blouse, the sound of a music box
Comes from inside a toy chest, but what do I do, it's locked
I pick it and open it but it’s stuffed full of human parts
I dig till I find it, I wind it up and the tune just starts
Its playing a song, so beautiful and the room is dark
The moon is full, I smell a funeral, guess I'll loom in the park

Cos when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep (My music box)
But I can hear my luck keep calling me (My music box)
When were worlds apart, you mean the world to me (My music box)
? I will answer (My music box)

Cos when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep (My music box)

I'm fixated on asphyxiating and breakin' this little chick's
Neck like a pixie stick
The sick Satan worshippin', bitches get horse-whippins,
I'm in the back, through the back door, slip in
Through the crack leavin' the corpse drippin'
The mortician of love, sent from above,
forced and treat em all
stingy I've become
Been doin' this for more than a quarter century, I'm just numb
Am I dreamin', is it real Someone pinch me on the buns
The time has come to tie her up, gotta roll me the ladder
I'd had enough of the chatter, climb up to the window, look at her
then climb in and slowly shatter her brain matter and batter her
with the bat, a matter of fact that will splatter her
But before I do that, I'll have a chat to flatter her
Give her two compliments, back-to-back, like Tabatha
I'm your secret admirer, I'm back to ravish ya
So strong is your fight, but your no match for Dracula
Prolonging her plight, as I go back to stabbin' her
Dismember her limbs, simple as that, cadaver her
Zoom in with the lens, then pan back, the camera
Stand back, cuz here comes your man Jack, so Pamela

Cos when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep (My music box)
But I can hear my luck keep calling me (My music box)
When were worlds apart, you mean the world to me (My music box)
? I will answer (My music box)

Cos when the lights are off, I see the girls asleep (My music box)
But I can hear my luck keep calling me (My music box)
When were worlds apart, you mean the world to me (My music box)

"We rented a truck and a semi to go

Travel down the long and winding road

Look on the map I think we've been here before,
Close the doors let's roll once more.

Cop on the corner, look he's startin' to write
I don't need no ticket so I screamed out of sight,

Drove so fast that my eyes can't see,

Look in the mirror is he still followin' me?
Let it roll down the highway

Let it roll down the highway,

Roll, roll.

Look at the sign, we're in the wrong place
Come on boys, let's get ready to race

454 coming over the hill

The man on patrol, is going to give us a bill.
The time's real short, you know the distance is long
I'd rather have a jet but it's not in the song
Climb back in the cab, cross your fingers for luck
We gotta keep movie' if we're going to make a buck.
Let it roll down the highway...

"I wish I was a neutron bomb, for once I could go off
I wish I was a sacrifice, but somehow still lived on
I wish I was a sentimental ornament you hung on
The Christmas tree, I wish I was the star that went on top

I wish I was the evidence, I wish I was the grounds
For fifty million hands upraised and open toward the sky

I wish I was a sailor with someone who waited for me
I wish I was as fortunate, as fortunate as me
I wish I was a messenger and all the news was good
I wish I was the full moon shining off your Camaro's hood

I wish I was an alien at home behind the sun
I wish I was the souvenir you kept your house key on
I wish I was the pedal brake that you depended on
I wish I was the verb ""to trust"" and never let you down

I wish I was a radio song, the one that you turned up",2

There's one thing on your mind
Hoping they're looking for you
Sure you'll be rummaging through

For you to say the first word
So you're waiting and waiting and

The only reason that you came
So what you're scared for?
Well, don't you always do the same?
It's what you're there for, don't you know?

The lights are flashing
Down in here tonight
And some might exchange a glance
But keep pretending to dance
Don't act like it's not happening
As if it's impolite
To go and mention your name
Instead you'll just do the same
As they all do and hope for the best

The only reason that you came
So what you're scared for?
Well, don't you always do the same?
It's what you're there for, but no

Get on your dancing shoes

"You're too far to bring you close 
And too high to see below 
Just hangin' on your daily dose 

I know you never needed anyone 
But the rolling papers for your grass 
How can you give what you don't have 

You keep on aiming for the top 
And quit before you sweat a drop 
Feed your empty brain 
With your hydroponic pot 
Start out playing with yourself 
You get more fun within your shell 
Nice to meet you but I gotta go my way 

I'll leave again 'cause I've been waiting in vain 
But you're so in love with yourself 
If I say my heart is sore 
Sounds like a cheap metaphor 
So I won't repeat it no more 

I rather eat my soup with a fork 
Or drive a cab in New York 
'Cause to talk to you is harder work 

So what's the point of wasting all my words 
If it's just the same or even worse 
Than reading poems to a horse 

You keep on aiming for the top 
And quit before you sweat a drop 
Feed your empty brain 
With your hydroponic pot 
I bet you'll find someone like you 
'Cause there's a foot for every shoe 
And I wish you luck but I've other things to do 

I'll leave again 'cause I've been waiting in vain 
But you're so in love with yourself 
If I say my heart is sore 
Sounds like a cheap metaphor 
So I won't repeat it no more 

I'll leave again 'cause I've been waiting in vain 

If I say my heart is sore 
Sounds like a cheap metaphor

She starts to comb her hair

She looks at her reflection off the wall
Why do I care at all

Don't hide out inside yourself
If you only let the sun shines on you
I promise you

You're not alone
when the lights go out at night
When you're feeling lost inside

You're not alone

I will be the one around

She's sitting on her own
just an ordinary day
Just an ordinary day
She's looking at the people passing her by
It could be you and I
They would never dream of slowing down to see
if she's alright
Don't hide out inside yourself
If you only let the sun shines on you
I promise you

You're not alone

"When I wake up in the morning
feel the sun shine on my face
I get up and I’m yawning
There is so much time I can waste

Cause I need this
God feed me with your love
And take me through the day

Fool me into believing
I don’t care if your deceiving me
I wouldn’t want it any other way
‘Cause then I’d only stay the same

Fool me into believing
I don’t care if your deceiving me

When I wake up in the dawning
And the day is not far away
Find my way in a dark room
That my eyes fail to see through

If God made me
Will Jesus save me?
And take me through the day

Fool me into believing
I don’t care if your deceiving me
I wouldn’t want it any other way
‘Cause then I’d only stay the same

Fool me into believing
I don’t care if your deceiving me
Before I go I need to be
Something more than the skin and bones you see

‘Cause everywhere I go
Everywhere I’ve been
And everywhere I’m going to
I only go with you

"Let's read the trees and their autumn leaves
As they fall like a dress undone
At the end of summers, love will find lovers
Who need the shadow of a winter's sun

Don't tell me you're leaving
We can hide in the evening
It's getting darker than it should
If we read the leaves as they blow in the breeze
Would it stop us now, my love?

Time enough for hard questions,
time enough for all our fears
Time is tougher than we both know yet
time enough for tears

The moon is milk and the sky
where it's spilt, it's magic
And we all need to believe
that we can wake in the dream
It's not as hard as it seems
you know, it's harder to leave

Time enough for being braver,
time enough for all our fears
Time is tougher than we both know yet
time enough for tears

I heard you say
underneath your breath some kind of prayer
I heard you say
underneath your breath
That you never wanna feel this way about anybody else

Time enough for hard questions,
time enough for all our fears
Time, it's tougher than we both know yet
time enough for tears
Time enough for being braver, time enough
I love this time of year
Time, it's tough, it's running away from us
time enough for tears
Time enough...

(It's OK, it's OK...)

"I've got a pocket full of money I shouldn't spend
To drink him away again
My heart stops cold in my chest
There he is in the back of the bar, looking his best

He passes me by and grabs a stranger's hand
He pulls her on the floor to dance
Oh no, I don't understand
He don't even know who I am

He's just an old memory
That don't remember me
And I can't get over him
Though it's been so long since he chose to leave
And I'm a grown woman
I should've already set myself free
From that old memory that don't remember me
He don't remember me

But I remember the smell of his cologne
And tonight he has it on
And I remember the feel of his skin
And I can't help but go back there again

No, he's just an old memory
That don't remember me
And I can't get over him
Though it's been so long since he chose to leave
And I'm a grown woman
I should've already set myself free
From that old memory that don't remember me

He talks in eyes only
silently, whispering..

he kicks it with happiness
 
The harmonium of his eyelids (which keep going up and down all the time like a harmonium's air-filler)
He, on the rhythm of heartbeats
keeps on singing lovely songs
 
Don't consider him innocent
He is a very clever player
He will extinguish the sun
such a blow he will give
in the yard, the pond, under the Peepal tree,
He leaves no street..
 
He talks in eyes only...
He dives in the river of dreams...

The mother got turned off (she died)
Every dream ended
The child sheds tears mute only
The child cannot listen to the rattling toy",1

And all you left was time
To find a solid grave

We watched Titanic and it didn't make us sad
I took you to Best Buy
You took me home to meet your mom and dad

Your mom cooked meat loaf, even though I don't eat meat
I dug you so much, I took some for the team
Your dad was silent
His eyes were fixed to what was on TV

And the conversation stopped, and I looked down at the ring
Your folks were next to you
And you were right there next to me

taking on the world together

made my parents' mistakes.

Buried in the backyard shadow

The ivory Your only solace,

Structures from silence,
Petals in the stream,
Murk above the dark moor,

It feels so wrong, I'm barely holdin' on

She ain't showin me love
I'm down on my love

"This old mountain side
Where we used to reside
Is slowly recalling
The things we discovered inside

Oh the crystal caves

We shed both our jackets
And I hammered brackets
From old metal chairs
To the walls, a crude set of stairs

To lead us down

And you tied a rope
To the steepening slope
A jerry rigged harness
So we could descend in the dark

But the tide came in

And we found ourselves in the sea
Deep under water
We both found that we could still breathe
So we spent the day submerged

And we swam the evening away

The water was clear
Like the pure atmosphere
As we kicked and fluttered
Through caverns all cluttered with age

In the afterglow

We swim hand and hand
Over white satin sand
And you left a ribbon
To honor the pale gibbon moon

But that was years ago

And we never came up for air
Down there
We can go anywhere

The old world was dying
While we took our flying
Like peregrine falcons
Beneath the transparent blue waves

Far below the surf

And we spent the hours
With submarine flowers
I knew I'd remember
That day in November
As we
Felt alive again

Cuz we found ourselves in the sea
Deep underwater
We both found that we could still breathe
So we spent the day submerged
And we swam the evening away
We swam the evening away

"¡Unos, dos, tres, catorce!

Lights go down, it's dark
The jungle is your head
Can't rule your heart
A feeling so much stronger than
A thought
Your eyes are wide
And though your soul
It can't be bought
Your mind can wander

Hello, hello! (¡Hola!)
I'm at a place called Vertigo! (¿Dónde está?)
It's everything I wish I didn't know
Except you give me something I can feel, feel

The night is full of holes
As bullets rip the sky
Of ink with gold
They twinkle as the boys
Play rock and roll
They know that they can't dance
At least they know

I can't stand the beats
I'm asking for the cheque
The girl with crimson nails
Has Jesus round her neck
Swinging to the music
Swinging to the music
Oh...

Hello, hello! (¡Hola!)

you had in mind

in the hours of waste
and I will be
more than it takes
to you

it was different time and place
how we used to sit on the fence and wait for her
like a game

Tried so hard to be like you
Flew too high and burnt the wing
Lost my faith in everything
Lick around devine debris
Taste the wealth of hate in me

Made the choice to go away
Drink the fountain of decay
Tear a hole exquisite red
Fuck the rest and stab it dead
Broken bruised forgotten sore
Too fucked up to care any more
Poisoned to my rotten core
Too fucked up to care any more
Broken bruised forgotten sore

Poisoned to my rotten core

far away

i needed to
all alone
by myself
where were you?
how could i ever think
it's funny how everything
that swore it wouldn't change
is different now
just like you
would always say
we'd make it through

fell apart

You said I must eat so many lemons
\'cause i am so bitter.
I said
\""I\'d rather be with your friends mate \'cause they are much fitter.\""

You got your boys and got gone and left us all alone

Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we gone
Best believe we gone forever
Don't be the reason
Don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad
We die forever

We gone forever

"It's hidden well deep inside
You don't want me to tell you why

Means everything to me

"This is a crisis I knew had to come, destroying the balance I'd kept
Doubting, unsettling and turning around, wondering what will come next
Is this the role that you wanted to live? I was foolish to ask for so much
Without the protection and infancy's guard, it all falls apart at first touch

Watching the reel as it comes to a close, brutally taking its time
People who change for no reason at all, it's happening all of the time
Can I go on with this train of events disturbing and purging my mind?
Back out of my duties, when all's said and done. I know that I'll lose every time

Moving along in our God-given ways, safety is sat by the fire
Sanctuary from these feverish smiles, left with a mark on the door
Is this the gift that I wanted to give? Forgive and forget's what they teach
Or pass through the deserts and wastelands once more and watch as they drop by the beach

This is the crisis I knew had to come, destroying the balance I'd kept
Turning around to the next set of lives, wondering what will come next",2
"I see a red door and I want it painted black
No colors anymore, I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I see a line of cars and they are painted black
With flowers and my love both never to come back
I see people turn their heads, they quickly look away
Like a new born baby it just happens every day

I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door and it's heading into black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted black, oh baby
I wanna see it painted, painted, painted black, oh baby

No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you
If I look hard enough into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me before the morning comes

I wanna see it painted, painted, painted black
Oh, black as night black as coal
I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky
Painted, painted, painted black, oh baby
Painted, painted, painted black

Somewhere cold and caked in snow
By the fire, we break the quiet
Learn to wear each other well

And the world feels like graves of dirt

You can imagine this place
Yeah, our secret space, at will

And you'll feel dizzy, light and free
And falling gently on the cushion
You can come and sing to me

Pour me a heavy dose of atmosphere

But I'll miss your arms around me 
I'd send a postcard to you dear 
'Cause I wish you were here 

I'll watch the night turn light blue 
But it's not the same without you 
Because it takes two to whisper quietly 
The silence isn't so bad 
Till I look at my hands and feel sad 
'Cause the spaces between my fingers 
Are right where yours fit perfectly 

I'll find repose in new ways 
Though I haven't slept in two days 
'Cause cold nostalgia chills me to the bone 
But drenched in vanilla twilight 
I'll sit on the front porch all night 
Waist-deep in thought because when I think of you 
I don't feel so alone 

I don't feel so alone 
I don't feel so alone 

As many times as I blink 
I'll think of you tonight 

I'll think of you tonight 

When violet eyes get brighter 
And heavy wings grow lighter 
I'll taste the sky and feel alive again 
And I'll forget the world that I knew

Opened up and let you in

The mark I've borne, a mark of scorn
To you

Consume my love, devour my hate
Only powers my escape
The moon is out, the stars invite

Soon I'll find myself alone
To relax and fade away

"All right, (hmm)
It's so funny runnin' into you
It has to be three years

Many flashbacks come to mind
Of the wild and crazy times
We used to have with one another

We absolutely didn't care
We would do it anywhere
Eye contact, and it was over, hmm
But that's when I was wild, and now
I couldn't care less about
Someone gettin' hurt
I've done my share of dirt
But I done wised up

Chorus - Seein' you reminds me of
All the nights I used to beat it up
I would do it again, but I can't
'Cause everything is different now
I finally have settled down
And became a one woman man

Ooh
There were many others after you
Quite a few one night stands
Some of their names I can't remember
Imagine wakin' up with someone who
You barely even knew
Time and time again

But there's someone for everyone
I've been blessed to find that one
Who makes me feel like no other
You are lookin' good as hell
But I can't go home with you
Because I'm goin' home to her

Long gone, are the days
When I ran the streets
Tryin' to get laid
Ooh, and now

Girl, it was nice seein' you
But I gotta go home to my baby boo

Making excuses for his dodgy holiday

They didn\'t know that his faith was earthly bound

He found an island off the coast of Mexico
Leaving his lover and his family behind.

And on his journey and his travels on the way,

He met a girlie who was brave enough to say,
When they made love he shared the burden of his mind.

Maybe someday you'll look up
And barely conscious you'll say to no one
""Isn't something missing?""

You won't cry for my absence I know
You forgot me long ago
Am I that unimportant?
Am I so insignificant?
Isn't someone missing me?

Even though I'm the sacrifice,
You won't try for me, not now.
Though I'd die to know you love me,
I'm all alone.
Isn't someone missing me?

Can you stop, please?
Can you stop the fire?
You can't stop the fire,
You won't say the words.
Please, Please

Please, please forgive me
But I won't be home again.
I know what you do to yourself,
I breathe deep and cry out,
""Isn't something missing?
Isn't someone missing me?""

Even though I'm the sacrifice,
You won't try for me, not now.
Though I'd die to know you love me,
I'm all alone.
Isn't someone missing me?

And if I bleed,
I'll bleed:
Knowing you don't care.
And if I sleep,
Just to dream of you,
And wake without you there.
Isn't something missing?
Isn't something...?

Even though I'm the sacrifice,
You won't try for me, not now.
Though I'd die to know you love me,
I'm all alone.
Isn't something missing?
Isn't someone missing me?

Can you stop, please?
Can you stop the fire?
You can't stop the fire,
You won't say the words.
Please, Please",2

I got the TV on, 
the sound turned down and a bottle of wine
There's pictures of you 
and I on the walls around me
The way that it was 
and could have been surrounds me
I'll never get over you walkin' away

I've never been the kind to ever 
let my feelings show
And I thought that bein' strong meant 
never losin' your self-control
But I'm just drunk enough to let got of my pain
To hell with my pride, let it fall like rain
From my eyes
Tonight I wanna cry

Would it help if I turned a sad song on
""All By Myself"" would sure hit me hard now 
that you're gone
Or maybe unfold some old yellow lost love letters
It's gonna hurt bad before it gets better
But I'll never get over you by hidin' this way

I've never been the kind to ever 
let my feelings show
And I thought that bein' strong meant
never losin' your self-control

"Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears
While we all sup sorrow with the poor
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears
Oh, hard times come again no more

'Tis a song' a sigh of the weary
Hard times' hard times come again no more
Many days you have lingered around my cabin door
Oh' hard times come again no more

While we seek mirth and beauty
And music light and gay
There are frail ones fainting at the door
Though their voices are silent
Their pleading looks will say
Oh, hard times come again no more

'Tis a song' a sigh of the weary
Hard times... hard times come again no more
Many days you have lingered around my cabin door
Oh, hard times come again no more

'Tis a sigh that is wafted across the troubled wave
'Tis a wail that is heard upon the shore
'Tis a dirge that is murmured around the lowly grave
Oh, hard times come again no more

'Tis a song'a sigh of the weary
Hard times' hard times come again no more
Many days you have lingered around my cabin door
Oh, hard times come again no more
Oh, hard times come again no more",2

"Storming through the party
Like my name was El ninio
When I'm hangin' out drinkin'
In the back of an El camino
As a kid, I was a skid and
No-one knew me by name
I trashed my own house party
'Cause nobody came
I know I'm not the
One you thought you knew
Back in high school
Never going, ever showing up
When we had to
Is it attention that we crave
Don't tell us to behave
I'm sick of always hearing
""Act your age""
I don't want
To waste my time
And become a
Casualty of society
I'll never fall in line
Become a victim
Of your conformity
And back down
Be-cause, you don't
Know us at all
We laugh when old people fall
But what would you expect
With a conscience so small
Heavy metal and mullets
It's how we were raised
Maiden and priest
Were the Gods that we praised
'Cause we like having fun
At other peoples expense and,
Cutting people down is
Just a minor offence then
It's none of your concern
I guess I'll never learn
I'm sick of being told to
""Wait my turn""
I don't want
To waste my time
And become a
Casualty of society
I'll never fall in line
Become a victim
Of your conformity
And back down
Don't count on me
To let you know when
Don't count on me
I'll do it again
Don't count on me
It's the point you're missing
Don't count on me
'Cause I'm not listening
Well I'm a no goodnick
Lower middle class brat,
Back packed and I don't
Give a sh*t about nothing
You be standing on the corner
Talking all that kufuffin
But you don't make sense from
All the gas you be huffing
Then if the egg don't stain
You'll be ringing off the hook,
You're on the hit list wanted
In the telephone book
I like songs with distortion
To drink in proportion
The doctor said my mom
Should have had an abortion
I don't want
To waste my time
And become a
Casualty of society
I'll never fall in line
Become a victim
Of your conformity
And back down
Waste my time with them
Casualty of society
Waste my time again,
Victim of your conformity
And back down

"Gotta get myself together
Try to make it through tonight
Tell myself the way we were never broken
There are times thought I might be
Finding ways to make it right
That you walked away and opened up my eyes
Now I see that I have been wasting time
I had a picture of us painted in my mind
Now it's fading and there was nothing left to do
Letting go, cuz I know
we were only half way there
Eventhough we were close
I was holding on just long enough to know
I should be Letting go
I should be Letting go

Thinking back on when you used to
Fill my head with fancy words
Wishing now that I refuse to listen
How did I ever let it happen
Never thought I would never say
Gotta leave this life and all the foolish pain
Now I see that I have been wasting time
I had a picture of us painted in my mind
Now it's fading and there was nothing left to do
we were only half way there
Eventhough we were close
I was holding on just long enough to know
Now I see that I have been wasting time
I had a picture of us painted in my mind
Now it's fading and there was nothing left to do
we were only half way there
Eventhough we were close
I was holding on just long enough to know

"When I was just a little baby boy
My mamma used to tell me these crazy things
She used to tell me my daddy was an evil man
She used to tell me he hated me
But then I got a little bit older and I realized 
she was the crazy one
And there was nothing I could do or say to change her
Cause that's just the way she was
They said I can't rap about being broke no more
They didn't say I can't rap about coke no more
(Ahh)
Slut, you think I won't choke no whore
Till her vocal cords don't work in her throat no more
(Ahh)
These motherfuckers are thinking I'm playin'
Thinking I'm sayin' this shit 'cause I'm thinkin' it
Just to be sayin' it
(Ahh)
Put your hands down bitch I ain't gon' shoot you
I'mma pull you to this bullet and put it through you
(Ahh)
Shut up, slut you're causing too much chaos
Just bend over and take it like a slut, ok ma
Oh, now he's raping his own mother, abusing her
Worse snortin' coke, and we gave him the Rolling Stone cover?
You're goddamn right bitch, and now it's too late
I'm triple-platnum and tragedies happened in two states
I invented violence you vile, venomous, vomital bitches
Vain, vicadin, vrin-vrin-vrin
Touch this chainsaw, left his brains all
Dangling from his neck while his head barely hangs on
Blood, guts, guns, cuts
Knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts
Bitch, I'mma kill you
You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls leave, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch, I'mma kill you
You don't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin'
I don't squash the beef
You better kill me
I'mma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me
I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too, you ain't nothin' but a girl to me
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady
(Cause why?)
Cause Shady will fuckin' kill you
(Ha-ha)
You don't wanna fuck with Shady
(Why?)
Cause Shady will fuckin' kill you
Bitch, I'mma kill you
Like a murder weapon I'mma conceal you
In a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows & film you
Fuck with me, I've been through hell, shut the hell up
I'm try-na to develop these pictures of the devil to sell them
I ain't Acid Rap but I rap on acid
Got a new blow torch and just had a strap-on added
Woops, is that a subliminal hint? No!
It's criminal intent, to sodomize women again
Eminem offend? No, Eminem'll assault
And if you ever give it to him you'll give him an impulse
To do it again, then if he does it again
You probabaly end up jumping out of something up in the tents
Bitch, I'mma kill you
I ain't done, this ain't the chorus
I ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it three or four times
In a tub but that's normal ain't it Norman?
Serial killer hiding murder material
In a cereal box on top of your stereo
Here we go again, we're out of out medicine Out of our minds, 
and we want in yours Let us in
Or I'mma kill you
You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls leave, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch, I'mma kill you
You don't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin'
I don't squash the beef
You better kill me
I'mma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me
I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too, you ain't nothin' but a girl to me
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady
(Cause why?)
Cause Shady will fuckin' kill you
(Ha-ha)
You don't wanna fuck with Shady
(Why?)
Cause Shady will fuckin' kill you
He-heh
Know why I say these things
Cause ladies screams be creepin' in Shady's dreams
And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks
These eighty g's so he can say the same things tweece
Twice, whatever, I hate these things
Fuck shots, I hope this weed'll outweigh these drinks
Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
Just to argue with them 'cause their ratings stink?
Fuck that, I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
From that bitch to all seventy thousand pounds of her
From the princapal to student body and counseler
From in school to before school to outta school
I don't even believe in breathin'
I'm leavin' air in your lungs so you can keep screamin'
For me to seep it
Okay, I'm ready to go play
I got the machette from OJ
I'm ready to make everyone's throats ache
You faggots keep egging me on
Till I have you at knife point then you beg me to stop?
Shut up, give me your hands and feet
I said shut up when I'm talking to you
You hear me? Answer me
Or I'mma kill you
You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls leave, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch, I'mma kill you
You don't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin'
I don't squash the beef
You better kill me

"Please come out tonight I need you here
It's been a long, long time and I can't wait
Let's find out, let's see what it's like out there
If it rains we'll find somewhere, somewhere dry and warm

You'll say 'my, it's been a long, long time'
I'll say 'how are you? I've been fine'

Please come out tonight, let's go out and see the world
We can try to find, find somewhere
It seems so long ago, I can hardly remember the time
It's all I want, it's all I want, so let's see what we find

You'll say 'there's so much you need to know'
I'll say 'are you really sure you have to go?'

We don't need a reason, no explainations
Just stay with me here, tonight
I won't say a word
I just need you here

Please come out tonight, let's go out and find ourselves
You can lean your head on my shoulder, remember?

You'll say 'My, is that the time?'
I'll say 'why not stay with me tonight?'

Just lay here beside me
Just see what it's like

Holding on too long without any hands

Hold on to my Father's hand
(God will heal you, make you, like new)
Time will bring you to

And the crystal tears they fall and flower in a barren land

And I start to cry
I'm lost without your love
And I won't survive
Don't leave me alone tonight
I'm lost without your love and I won't survive

I can't believe that we are through
Is it someone else?
Have ya found somebody new?
'Cause I die inside every time I close my eyes
And imagine myself living without you

But you turned away
And I start to cry
I'm lost without your love
And I won't survive
Don't leave me
Alone tonight
I'm lost without your love
And I won't survive",1
"I'm diggin' with my fingertips
I'm gripping at the ground I stand upon
I'm searching for fragile bones
Evolution
I'm never gonna be refined
Keep trying but I won't assimilate
Should we have come far in time
Watch the ground break
And I'm sorry that I don't believe
By the evidence that I see
That there's any hope left for me
It's evolution
Just evolution
And I, I do not dare deny
The basic beast inside
It's right here
It's controlling my mind
And why do I deserve to die
I'm dominated by
This animal that's locked up inside
Close up to get a real good view
I'm betting that the species will survive
Hold tight, I'm getting inside you
Evolution
And when were gonna find these bones
They're gonna want to keep them in a jar
The number one virus caused by
Procreation
And the planet may go astray
In a million years they'll say
Those motherfuckers we're all derranged
It's evolution
Just evolution
And I, I do not dare deny
The basic beast inside
It's right here
It's controlling my mind
And why do I deserve to die

"I'm not sure who's fooling who here
As I'm watching your decay
We both know you could deflate
A 7 hurricane
Seems like you and your tribe
Decided you'd rewrite the law
Segregate the mind
From Body and from soul

You give me yours
I'll give you mine
Cause I can look your God
Right in the eye
You give me yours
I'll give you mine
You used to look my God
Right in the eye

I believe in defending
In what we once
Stood for
It seems in vogue
To be a closet
Misogynist homophobe
A change of course in
Our direction
A dash of truth
Spread thinly
Like a flag
On a popstar
On a Benzodiazapene
You give me yours
I'll give you mine
Cause I can look your God
Right in the eye
You give me yours
I'll give you mine
You used to look my God
Right in the eye

Oh Zion please
Remove your glove
And dispel every trace
Of His spoken word
That has lodged
In my vortex

I'm not sure who's fooling who here
As I'm watching your decay

People dying in their Name

"How to fight loneliness

Smile all the time

Shine your teeth to meaningless

And sharpen them with lies

And whatever is going down

Will you follow around

That's how you fight loneliness

You laugh at every joke

Drag your blanket blindly
Fill your heart with smoke

And the first thing that you want

Will be the last thing you'll ever need

That's how you fight it

Just smile all the time

Just smile all the time

Just smile all the time

Just smile all the time

It cannot be described in two words
This is a new story of a boy and a girl
It cannot be described in two words.
 
When I gave my heart to you,I conquered a place
Which I never thought I would,because it was at a distance of many miles
Oh God why did you show me such dreams?
When in fact it was to be broken?
 
In one second we both were together,though it was meant only for one second
Yours and mine,mine and yours love story is difficult
It cannot be described in two words
 
Every second of our conversation was the most colorful of all
It cannot be described in two words
In every feeling you are there,in every memory I desire for you
It cannot be described in two words
 
Every day has gone by,every night spent awake
Because of my care for you,every second I am suffering
I am suffering,let the distance
And all the other things standing between us vanish
 
In one second we both were together,though it was meant only for one second
Every second of our conversation made me unaware of the surroundings
It cannot be described in two words
In every feeling you are there,in every memory I desire for you
It cannot be described in two words",2

"I can only say these things to you while you're sleeping
I hear the hum from the wires and the sounds of the morning creep in
I lie awake and pretend you can hear me

And you tell me that you're scared that you're turning into your mother
And I feel myself turn into my father
We could lie to each other like they do and say we're so happy
It's easy when you're young and you still want it so badly

And I feel my heart pounding
And I think that I might scream

I can tell you that you're all I ever wanted, dear
And I can utter every word you've ever hope to hear
But I shudder when I think that I might not be here forever, forever, forever

That night you whispered like a ghost and you looked so shaken
You were so quiet and small and you tell me you wanted to be taken
I just never think of you as the kind of girl who would say that
And you suddenly seem like some faceless thing in my grasp
Your eyes so wide, your face so low
It's the face of someone I don't know
I can tell you that you're all I ever wanted, dear
And I can utter every word you'd ever hope to hear
Shudder when I think that I might not be here forever, forever, forever

And all I could think is that it must be a kind of rebellion
To arm our fears like soldiers and slay them.
I can tell you that you're all I've ever wanted, dear
Through the dim while you're breathing, while you're sleeping in here
Waken and you ask me if I'm going to be here forever, forever, forever
Your face so twisted and your eyes are light
I want to tell I can save you when you cry at night
But I'd be lying
Love is defying

"I hear this old story before
If people keep appealing for the metaphors
Don't leave much up to the imagination
So I, wanna give this imagery back
No it just aint so easy like that
I turn the page and read the story again
And again and again
just seems the same, with a diff  name
breaking and rebuilding
And we're growing
Always guessing
Never knowing
Shocking but we're nothing
We're just moments
We're Clever but we're clueless
We're just human
Amusing but confusing
Were trying but where is this all leading
Never Know

It all happened so much faster
Than you could say disaster
Wanna take a time lapse
And look at it backwards
From the last one
And maybe thats just the answer
That we're after
But after all
We're just a bubble in a boiling pot
Just one breath in a chain of thought
The moments just combusting
Feel certain but we'll never never know
Just seems the same
Give it a diff. name
beggin and we're needing
And we're trying and we're breathing
Never knowing
Shocking but we're nothing
We're just moments
We're Clever but we're clueless
We're just human
Amusing but confusing
Helping, we're builign
And we're growing
Never Know

Knock knock on the door to door
Tell ya that the metaphor is better than yours
And you can either sink or swim
Things are looking pretty grim
If you dont believe in what this one feeding
Its got no feeling
So I read it again
And again and again
Just seems the same
Too many different names
Our hearts are strong our hands are weak
We'll always be competing
Never knowing
Shocking but we're nothing
We're just moments
We're Clever but we're clueless
We're just human
Amusing but confusing
But the truth is
All we got is questions
We'll Never Know
Never Know

And 20,000 reasons to get up,
Get something done, but I'm still waiting
Is someone kind enough to pick me up and give me food,
Assure me that the world is good
But you should be here, you should be here

How colors can change and even the texture of the rain
And what's that ugly little stain on the bathroom floor
I'd rather not deal with that right now
I'd rather be floating in space somewhere or
Worry about the ozone layer

And it's almost like a corny movie scene
But I'm out of frame and the lighting's bad
And the music has no theme
And we're all so strong when nothing's wrong
And the world is at our feet
But how small we are when our love is far away
And all you need is you",2
"In this world, if you read the papers, darling,
You know everybody's fighting on with each other.
You got no one you can count on, dear,
Not even your own brother.
So if someone comes along,
He's gonna give you some love and affection
I'd say get it while you can, yeah!
Honey, get it while you can yeah,
Hey, hey, get it while you can,
Don't you turn your back on love, no, no! 

Don't you know when you're loving anybody, baby,
You're taking a gamble on a little sorrow,
But then who cares, baby,
'Cause we may not be here tomorrow, no.
And if anybody should come along,
He gonna give you any love and affection,
I'd say get it while you can, yeah!
Hey, hey, get it while you can,
Hey, hey, get it while you can.
Don't you turn your back on love,
No no no, no no no no no. 

Oh, get it while you can,
Honey get it when you're gonna wanna need it dear, yeah yeah,
Hey hey, get it while you can,
Don't you turn your back on love,
No no no, no no no no, get it while you can yeah,
I said hold on to somebody when you get a little lonely, dear,
Hey hey, hold on to that man's heart,
Yeah, get it, want it, hold it, need it,
Get it, want it, need it, hold it,
Get it while you can,

"Oh the sky`s grey
On this workday
You`re just playing along
Just to see the day through
You`re lonely and blue
Writings on the window
There`s a deep longing sigh
You`re far off in thoughts
You heart`s grown all cold

Let it rain， rain
It`s the perfect weather for contemplating
Let it rain， rain
For after such a weather
Sunshine will come

The rainbows
And the laughter
And the serious smile
It`s teasing you pal
Like it`s coming to get you

Oh they wish for you
To be happy again
But you`re locked up inside
You`re missing your cue
Feeling weary
Stop running away
You`re finding it hard to breathe

Let it rain， rain
It`s the perfect weather for contemplating
Let it rain， rain
For after such a weather
Sunshine will come

Let it rain， rain
It`s the perfect weather for contemplating
Let it rain， rain
For after such a weather
Sunshine will come

"I made a promise to myself
Locked it away deep down inside
Told my heart we’d wait it out
Swore we’d never compromise
Oh I’d rather be alone
Like I am tonight
settle for the kind of love
That fades before the morning light
Silence stared me in the face
And I finally heard it’s voice
It seemed to softly say
That in love you have a choice
Today I got the answer
And there’s a world of truth behind it
Love is out there waiting somewhere
You just have to go and find it
I believe in love, I believe in love
love that’s real, love that’s strong
Love that lives on and on
Yes I believe in love
I believe in love, I believe in love
love that’s real, love that’s strong
Love that lives on and on
Yes I believe in love
Yes I believe in love

Sitting in the summer sun

Drop that bomb on me?
Lazy days, crazy dolls

Seven days in sunny June
Were long enough to bloom
The flowers on the summer dress you wore in spring
The way we laughed as one

Could it be this?
You never gave me time to say I love you
Could it be this?
I know you don't believe me but it's so true
Don't walk away from me, girl
I read the stories in your eyes
Don't you walk away from me,

"We could go to the cinema
Big effects and big named stars
And we can go to that private view
But darling these days my favorite view is you
Lets just bend the invitation
And leave our bikes down at the station
Lose our sense of direction
There’s nothing here to lose

Oh you will run
Come get lost with me
Slip away discreetly
You’re my love
So come away with me
Lets get lost till empty

We could stay here till closing time
But the drinks are flat and the price is a crime
We could dance till our feet turn red
But the beats so boring
And I’d rather be home in our bed

This towns skipping like a record
Reruns get me so bored
So with enough that I can afford
Lets get lost
Again

Yeah we will run
Come get lost with me
Slip away discreetly

Come get lost with me
Till we run on empty

Game I trust don't play games it'll be dangerous
If you fuck me over
Cause if I get burnt I'mma show you what it's like to hurt
Cause I been treated like dirt before ya
And love is evil
Spell it backwards I'll show ya

Nobody knows me I'm cold
Walk down this road all alone
It's noones fault but my own
It's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow I show no emotion whatsoever so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these mufuckin' hos
Bloodsuckin suckubusses what the fuck is up with this
I've tried in this department but I ain't had no luck with this
It sucks but it's exactly what I thought it would be
Like tryin to start over
I gotta hole in my heart I'm some kind of emotional rollercoaster
Something I won't go on til you toy with my emotion so it's over
It's like an explosion everytime I hold ya wasn't jokin' when I told ya
Ya take my breathe away
You're a supernova.. And I'm a

And I aim it right at you
Right at you
250 thousand miles aim a keen eye right at you (?)
And I aim it right at you
Right at you
Right at you

I do whatever it takes
When I'm with you I get the shakes
My body aikes when I ain't
With you I have zero strength
Theres no limit on how far I would go
No boundries no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we thinks
Gonna be that one and then once we get em it's never the same
You want them when they don't want you
Soon as they do feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't lookin' but I stumbled onto you mustve been fate
But so much is at stake what the fuck does it take
Let's cut to the chase
But a door shuts in your face
Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open
That I won't be makin' a mistake

So after a year and 6 months it's no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts
Never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you
Let down my guard swear to god
I'll blow my brains in your lap
Lay here and die in your arms
Up to my knees and I'm bleedin'
I'm tryin' to stop you from leavin'
You won't even listen so fuck it
I'm tryin to stop you from breathin'
I put both hands on your throat
I sit on top of you squeezin'
Til I snap ya neck like a popsicle stick
Ain't no possible reason I could think of to let you walk up out this house
And let you live
Tears streamed down both of my cheeks
Then I let you just go and just give
And before I put that gun to my temple
I told you this

And I would do anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But it's over now
It's too late to save our love
Just promise me youll think of me everytime you look up in the sky and see a star cause I'm a

Cock back hammer, splatter matter all over cell phone and calendar

No peace, yeah, in the middle of a war zone
Riddle when the norm thinks slow
No sleep, yeah, with the shades down low
On the down low fighting with a dream

I don't need to speak
I'm paranoid like a man in the land of the free
To set up and let us burn turn cheek

Damn, stop like the octagon top of your block
I'm gone off my rock, no songs, no more locked
Just a little bit of prison sneakin' up on us
We won't listen till there isn't any more of us
These days we quick to part ways with rights, like, okay here
But let's be clear, for the record, I did not sign up for lockdown
Or any kind of shock and awe now, I'm so bored

You must have forgot just who you were dealing with
Nothing less than aggression
So naked, so crystal clear, with a trust
In absolutely fucking nothing but Doomtree
Step up your thought game lames, we all thirsty

It's like they leave us no option
Walkin' these streets here just watching
These preachers speak from their pockets
These teachers, bring it back
These teachers reach but can't stop it
Seedlings so poisoned, so lost
Just following prophets to nonsense
Tossin' what's right to the dust

And I ain't no casualty
Got no surface with spotless morality
My dirt might have to cover up my grave
But I keep my fear of faith and filth clutter up my cave
Got me lookin' for my disinfectant

Hey yo, this song is for anyone... fuck it, just shut up and listen
Hey yo

Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this... on this earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse

And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensin' these sentences gettin' this stress
That's been eatin' me recently off of this chest

And I rest again peacefully (peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter

To not come and speak to me (speak to me)
I don't know you and no, I don't owe you a mo-therfuck-ing thing
I'm not Mr. *NSYNC, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick

If you tempt me my tank is on empty (is on empty)
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you 10 feet (10 feet) in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me destroy you

Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of arguin' (of arguin)
I don't mean to be mean, but that's all I can be, it's just me

Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content.
That song ""Guilty Conscience"" has gotten such rotten responses.""

And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinky

Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school

And they blame it on Marilyn (on Marilyn) and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see an upper class city

Havin' this happenin' (this happenin' )
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way (rap this way)
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
To burn and it's burnin' and I have returned

That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on ""My Name Is""

And pigeonholed into some poppy sensation
That copped me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (got the patience)
To deal with these cocky caucasians

Who think, I'm some wigger who just tries to be black
'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
So they always keep askin' the same fuckin' questions (fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in?

The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
Till I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out (ahhh)
'Cause they drivin' me crazy (me crazy)
I can't take it, I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit

And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without someone standin' by it
No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am

I believe in you,
like a virgin, you're Madonna
And I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind

Hey soul sister,
ain't that mister mister on the radio, stereo
The way you move
ain't fair you know
Hey soul sister,
I don't wanna miss a single thing you do tonight

Well you can cut a rug
Watching you is the only drug I need
So gangster, I'm so thug
You're the only one I'm dreaming of
You see I can be myself now finally
In fact there's nothing I cant be
I want the world to see you'll be with me

Hey soul sister,
ain't that mister mister on the radio, stereo
The way you move ain't fair you know
Hey soul sister,
I don't wanna miss a single thing you do tonight
Hey soul sister,
I don't wanna miss a single thing you do tonight
Heeey heeeey heeeeey (tonight)
Heeey heeeey heeeeey (tonight)

Whenever I remember the moments that have gone by
My lips smile even in pain
Whenever I remember the moments that have gone by
The moments that have gone by
Even if it was for a few moments
But life met me with a smile
Even if it was for a few moments
But life met me with a smile
I spent my days in your lap
I spent my nights in your arms
Even today when I remember those moments
They make my heart forget all the grief
My lips smile even in pain
Whenever I remember the moments that have gone by
My lips smile even in pain
Whenever I remember the moments that have gone by
The moments that have gone by
You keeping your head on my shoulder
You hiding yourself in my chest
You keeping your head on my shoulder
You hiding yourself in my chest
You coming in my protection day and night
And you breaking up just like glass
Even today when I think about those sights
They erase all the loneliness in my heart

My lips smile even in pain

In pain ... the moments that have gone by

Cuz you need the whole cathedral,
To satisfy your needs,

Straight into the hand

Sometimes I just wanna hide 'cause it's you I miss

Would you help understand?
Are you looking down upon me?
Are you proud of who I am?

And remember when I moved in you
The holy dark was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

These iron bars can't hold my soul in

And oh, I scream for you

And I'll show you what I can be

And say it for me, say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth savin' me

Heaven's gates won't open up for me
With these broken wings I'm fallin'
And all I see is you
These city walls ain't got no love for me
I'm on the ledge of the eighteenth story
And oh, I scream for you

(Come, please, I'm callin')
And all I need from you
(Hurry, I'm fallin', I'm fallin', I'm fallin')

"Step one you say we need to talk
He walks you say sit down it's just a talk
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
And you begin to wonder why you came
Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
Let him know that you know best
Cause after all you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God he hears you
And pray to God he hears you
Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came
Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
How to save a life
How to save a life
Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
Where did I go wrong, I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life
How to save a life
How to save a life

"I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand I guess
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just let you know that, you're not alone
Hola if you feel that you've been down the same road
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take this thing out these words before I say 'em
Cause ain't no way I'm let you stop me from causing mayhem
When I say 'em or do something I do it, I don't give a damn
What you think, I'm doing this for me, so fuck the world
Feed it beans, it's gassed up, if a thing's stopping me
I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me I'm tearing down your balcony
No if ands or buts don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shit and
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shit's his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a fuck you for christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the earth he's got the urge
To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the universe

I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just let you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road
Ok quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap

I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that fuck your feelings, instead of getting crowned you're getting capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was ehhhh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't going back to that now

All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack BLAOW
Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't
This fucking black cloud's still follow's me around
But it's time to exercise these demons
These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now!
I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just let you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road

And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, Imma face my demons
I'm manning up, Imma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly i probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't even realise what you did, believe me you
I been through the ringer, but they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers, and drop dead
No more beef flingers, no more drama from now on, I promise
To focus soley on handling my responsibility's as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle lonely
Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Put a ??? and lift the whole liquor counter up
Cause I'm raising the bar, I shoot for the moon
But I'm too busy gazing at stars, I feel amazing and
I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just let you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road

Casting shadows on my face

I know I have a strength to move ahead

So I＇ll sit perfecty still

And I＇ll listen for a tune

When the mind is on the moon

And if I stumble

And if I stall

And if I slit now

And if I should fall

And if I cant be all that I could be

Will you, will you wait for me

Cause everywhere I seem to be

I am only passing through

I dream these days about the sea

Always wake up feeling blue

Wishing I could dream of you

So if I stumble

And if I fall

And if I slit now

And loose it all

And if I can＇t be all that I could be

Will you, will you wait for me

For scavengers like me.

And then consented to be wrecked,

In every cell of mine, there’s a desire to see You
It is limitless and infinite.

"Album: ¿Dónde están los ladrones?
Shakira
Tú

Te regalo mi cintura,
Y mis labios para cuando quieras besar,
Te regalo mi locura
Y las pocas neuronas que quedan ya.
Mis zapatos desteñidos,
El diario en el que escribo,
Te doy hasta mis suspiros,
Pero no te vayas más,
Porque eres tú mi sol,
La fe con que vivo,
La potencia de mi voz,
Los pies con que camino,
Eres tú, amor,
Mis ganas de reírme,
El adiós que no sabré decir 
Porque nunca podré vivir sin ti.
Si algún día decidieras,
Alejarte nuevamente de aquí,
Cerraría cada puerta,
Para que nunca pudieras salir.
Te regalo mis silencios,
Te regalo mi nariz,
Yo te doy hasta mis huesos,
Pero quédate aquí,
Porque eres tú mi sol,
La fe con que vivo,
La potencia de mi voz,
Los pies con que camino,
Eres tú, amor,
Mis ganas de reírme,
El adiós que no sabré decir 
Porque nunca podré vivir sin ti.

I give you my waist
and my lips, for when you want to kiss,
I give you my madness
and the few neurons they left me

My discolored shoes, the diary in which I write, I give even my sighs, 
but don't leave anymore

Because you are, my sun, the faith with I live
the strength of my voice
the feet I use to walk.
It is you my love, my desires to live
the goodbye I don't know how to say 
because I will be never able to live without you

If one of these day you would decide to get away from me
I would close every door, so you could never go out
I give you my silence, I give you my nose,
I give you even my bones, but stay here.

Because you are, my sun, the faith with I live
the strength of my voice
the feet I use to walk.
It is you my love, my desires to laugh
the goodbye I don't know how to say

Yet what if naught exists above?
No shining glory and no god

Your wooden idols and your law
Kneel before your god yet do not see
He doth feel you lies
Blinds you with fear
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth

With paws ov truth
With slashing jaws I rape

No god exists to save you from thy doom

I never think about looking back,
Cause time has no meaning when your free,
This is what you get,

"Lately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world where they can be alone
Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me? I'm reaching out for you

I'm just so fuckin' depressed, I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump, but I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps, fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up in order for me to pick the mic back up

I don't know how or why or when, I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm startin' to feel distant again, so I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent, but I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet

And I know some shit's so hard to swallow, but I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow, but I know one fact, I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow, I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow, but you'd have to walk a thousand miles

In my shoes just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each others' minds
Just to see what we'd find, look at shit through each others' eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)

I think I'm startin' to lose my sense of humor, everything's so tense and gloom I
Almost feel like I gotta check the temperature of the room, just as soon as I
Walk in, it's like all eyes on me and so I try to avoid any eye contact
'Cause if I do that, then it opens the door for conversation, like I want that

I'm not lookin' for extra attention, I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room, maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' man servant, tryin' to follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack and half of 'em ain't even funny like ""Hah!

Marshall you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, Goddamn!""
Unfortunately I am, I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down, listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes and you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles

In my shoes just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each others' minds
Just to see, what we'd find, look at shit through each others' eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)

Nobody asked for life to deal us, with these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves and flip 'em, don't expect no help
Now I could have either just sat on my ass and pissed an' moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in and get up and get my own

I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
Or sat on the porch and hoped and prayed for a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in, in every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid, even if it meant actin' stupid

Aunt Edna always told me, ""Keep makin' that face, it'll get stuck like that""
Meanwhile I'm just standin' there, holdin' my tongue tryin' to talk like this
Till I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
I learned my lesson then 'cause I wasn't tryin' to impress my friends no more

But I already told you my whole life story, not just based on my description
'Cause where you see it from where your sittin' it's probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile in each others' shoes at least
What size you wear, I wear 10's, let's see if you can fit your feet

In my shoes just to see what it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each others' minds
Just to see what we'd find, look at shit through each others' eyes

But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (so)

Lately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own. (Oh)
Everybody has their private world, where they can be alone. (So)
Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through? (Oh)
Are you reaching out for me? I'm reaching out for you. (So)

Spoken
Yeah, to my babies, stay strong. Dad'll be home soon.
And to the rest of the world, God gave you them shoes, to fit you.
So put 'em on and wear 'em.
Be yourself, man. Be proud of who you are.
Even if it sounds corny, don't ever let no one tell you you ain't beautiful. (So)",2
"god loves a lullaby
in a mother's tears in the dead of night
better than a hallelujah sometimes

god loves a drunkard's cry
the soldier's plea not to let him die
better than a hallelujah sometimes

we pour out our miseries
god just hears a melody
beautiful the mess we are
the honest cries, of breaking hearts
are better than a hallelujah

a woman holding on for life
a dying man giving up the fight
are better than a hallelujah sometimes

tears of shame for what's been done
the silence when the words won't come
are better than a hallelujah sometimes

we pour out our miseries,
god just hears a melody
beautiful the mess we are
the honest cries, of breaking hearts
are better than a hallelujah

better than a church bell ringing

"Have you ever felt some kind of emptiness inside
You will never measure up, to those people you
Must be strong, can't show them that you're weak

Have you ever told someone something
That's far from the truth
Let them know that you're okay
Just to make them stop
All the wondering, and questions they may have

I'm okay, I really am now
Just needed some time, to figure things out
Not telling lies, I'll be honest with you
Still we don't know what's yet to come

Have you ever seen your face,
In a mirror there's a smile
But inside you're just a mess,
You feel far from good
Need to hide, 'cos they'd never understand

Have you ever had this wish, of being
Somewhere else
To let go of your disguise, all your worries too
And from that moment, then you see things clear

I'm okay, I really am now
Just needed some time, to figure things out
Not telling lies, I'll be honest with you
Still we don't know what's yet to come

Are you waiting for the day
When your pain will disappear
When you know that it's not true
What they say about you
You could not careless about the things
Surrounding you
Ignoring all the voices from the walls

"When I am fast asleep
I dream and see you floating high above me
And I awake at dawn
Before the rays of morning paint the front lawn
From on the bedroom floor
I watch you sailing far above the seashore
In deep Atlantic skies
You float as I look aft to watch the moon rise
Above the avenue
I search among the clouds, trying to see you
But you are just a blur
In the sky when you parachute over the harbor
－－－
I can see
You above with the ocean around me
If I could only stay
Overhead in the airway
You sail through
Endless sky with the evening around you
When I’m out on the bay
You’re aloft in the airway
－－－
When I’m alone at night
I dream you paint the stars against the twilight
Suspended in the air
I wish your silhouette would always stay there
When I am on the beach
I watch you held aloft way out of my reach
But I cannot take flight
Or float upon the air the way that you might
When I am in the sea
You gaze down from the sky, trying to see me
But I am just a blur
Through the waves as I scuba dive below the harbor
－－－
The airway
You and I in the airway
Aloft in the airway
In love on the airway
－－－
I can see
You above with the ocean around me
If I could only stay
Overhead in the airway
You sail through
Endless sky with the evening around you

Learning to eat with a foreign tongue.

Learned the language of many a man.

And bend through alleys and bounce off all the buildings.

And it is true what you said
That I live like a hermit in my own head
But when the sun shines again

Just like a faucet that leaks and there is comfort in the sound
But while you debate half empty or half full
It slowly rises, your love is gonna drown

"It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles  the flowers  everything  is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you: feels wrong
You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said yes
You should've said no  you should've gone home
You should've thought twice before you let it all go
You should've know that word  bout what you did with her
Would get back to me
And I should've been there  in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no  baby and you might still have me

You can see that I've been crying
And baby you know all the right things  to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same
You say that the past is the past, you need one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said yes
You should've said no  you should've gone home
You should've thought twice before you let it all go
You should've know that word  bout what you did with her
Would get back to me
And I should've been there  in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no  baby and you might still have me
I can't resist  before you go  tell me this
Was it worth it
Was she worth this
No  no no no
You should've said no  you should've gone home
You should've thought twice before you let it all go
You should've know that word  bout what you did with her
Would get back to me

Should have seen the end of summer in your eyes
Should have listened when you said, ""Goodnight""
You really meant goodbye

If the river I cried ain't that long

Like we got away with the perfect crime
But we were just a legend in my mind
I guess that I was blind
Remember those nights dancing at the masquerade?
The clowns wore smiles that wouldn't fade
You and I were the renegades, some things never change

It made me so mad 'cause I wanted it bad for us, baby
And now it's so sad that whatever we had, ain't worth saving

"Woah, yeah
Do do do, oh

These are the days of the open hand
They will not be the last
Look around now
These are the days of the beggars and the choosers

This is the year of the hungry man
Whose place is in the past
Hand in hand
With ignorance and legitimate excuses

The rich declare themselves poor
And most of us are not sure
If we have too much
But we'll take our chances
'Cause God's stopped keeping score

I guess somewhere along the way
He must have let us all out to play
Turned his back and all God's children
Crept out the back door

And it's hard to love
There's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope
When there is no hope to speak of

And the wounded skies above
Say it's much, much too late
Well maybe we should all be praying for time

Do, do, do, oh
Mmm, woah yeah

These are the days of the empty hand
Oh you hold on to what you can
And charity
Is a coat you wear twice a year

This is the year of the guilty man
Your television takes a stand
And you find
That what was over there is over here

So you scream from behind your door
Say what's mine is mine and not yours
I may have too much
But I'll take my chances
'Cause God's stopped keeping score

And you cling to the things they sold you
Did you cover your eyes when they told you
That He can't come back
'Cause He has no children to come back for

It's hard to love
There's so much to hate
Hanging on to hope
When there is no hope to speak of

And the wounded skies above
Say it's much too late
So maybe we should all be praying for time

He's got the saints and apostles backing up from behind
Black eyed looks from those Bible books

The missionary man, he was following me
He said, ""Stop what you're doing, get down upon your knees.
I've a message for you that you better believe.""

"While this town is busy sleeping
All the noises died away
I walk the streets to stop my weeping
But she'll never change her ways
Don't fool yourself
She was heartache from the moment that you met her
My heart feels so still
As I try to find the will to forget her somehow
Oh I think I've forgotten her now
Her love is a rose pale and dying
Dropping her petals and man I know
All full of wine the world before her
But sober with no place to go
My heart is frozen still
She's somewhere out there now

Oh my tears folded down as I tried to forget
Her love was a joke from the day that we met
All of the words all of her men
All of my pain when I think back to when
Remember her hair as it shone in the sun
It was there on the bed when I knew what she'd done
Tell yourself over and over you wont ever need her again
But don't fool yourself
Oh my heart is frozen still
She's out there somewhere now
Oh
She was heartache from the day that i first met her
As I try to find the will to forget you somehow

Both just have to wait and see (wait and see)
If things go right we're meant to be

Verse 2:

The surfer is gone I scratched them off
We made some plans I let them go
Do you have the slightest idea (no I don't know)
Why the world is right when you're in it (is that so)
Stay a while and wait and see (wait and see)
If things go right we're meant to be

Chorus:

Oh what a world this life would be
Forget all your technicolor dreams
Forget modern nature
This is how it's meant to be

Verse 3:

The time is here for being straight
It's not too early and never too late
People say I should watch my pace (do that know)
""Think how you spend all your days"" (they all say so)
Those just have to wait and see (wait and see)
If things go right they'll have to agree
Oh what a world this life would be
Forget all your technicolor dreams
Forget modern nature
This is how it's meant to be

Chorus

Tadada da...
Do you have the slightest idea (no I don't)
Why the world is right when you're in it (is that so)
Stay a while we'll wait and see (wait and see)
If things go right we're meant to be
Oh what a world this life would be
Forget all your technicolor dreams
Forget modern nature
This is how it's meant to be

My traditional girl,
My traditional girl
girl girl girl girl (x2)
 
She drops her earring,
And if she meets your eye, she'll destroy your sight.
 
And if she dances,
Everybody's heartbeats beat in sync with her feet.
 
She lays her trap by her oceanic walk,
Making your heart a sorry state
All the romantics agree
They've never seen a girl like that
 
Never seen a girl like that
 
(Chorus)
I've seen a million foreign women,
But ain't nobody like my traditional girl.
 
I've seen a million foreign women,
But the most beautiful and simple is my traditional girl.
 
Who's the hottest girl in the world,
My traditional girl,
My traditional girl.
 
By the jerk of her waist, she'll rock your world
My traditional girl,
My traditional girl.
 
My traditional girl,
My traditional girl.
 
If your eye falls upon her waist,
All your dreams will be filled with colour
 
If she takes your hand
Lovers will lose their lives just smiling,
No matter where you look in the world,
You'll never find a girl like this.
 
I've seen a million foreign women,
But ain't nobody like my traditional girl.

My traditional girl,
My traditional girl.
 
My traditional girl,

Wherever I go,
All the eyes follow me
If I just stop for a moment,
All those cold breaths stop dead.
Everybody's eyes say
That they've dreamt of a girl like me,
A girl like me.

I've seen a million foreign women,
But ain't nobody like my traditional girl.

"A hundred days have made me older
Since the last time that I saw your pretty face

A thousand lies have made me colder
And I don't think I can look at this the same

All the miles that separate
Disappear now when I'm dreamin' of your face

I'm here without you baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time
I'm here without you baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight, there's only you and me.

The miles just keep rollin'
As the people leave their way to say hello

I've heard this life is overrated
But I hope that it gets better as we go.

I'm here without you baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time
I'm here without you baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight girl, there's only you and me.
Everything I know, and anywhere I go
It gets hard but it won't take away my love
And when the last one falls, when it's all said and done.
It gets hard but it won't take away my love

I'm here without you baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time
I'm here without you baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight girl, there's only you and me

"Down, chemical sacrament,
Blasphemous prayer.
Deliver me from this so serene apocalypse

Just make me fucking numb,
Deaf, blind and fucking dumb.
Return to sacred sleep.

This could be my requiem,
And I'll feel no pain.
This could be my requiem,
But don't bury me too deep.

Drain infected brine,
Sickened cesspool shell of mine.
Strap up the hands of time,
And push the soul into the vein

Just make me fucking numb,
Deaf, blind and fucking dumb.
Return to sacred sleep.

This could be my requiem,
And I'll feel no pain.
This could be my requiem,
But don't bury me too deep.

Sink, suffer, self destruct.
Rise, stronger, reconstruct.

Sink, suffer, self destruct.
Rise, stronger, reconstruct.

Dispose, discard, deny.
And I will feel no pain.

"Loving him is like driving a new
Maserati down a dead end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind
once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright, just before they lose it all
Losing him was blue, like I've never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
loving him was red
Touching him was like realizing
All you ever wanted was right there in ront of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing
all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword
And realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing
you'd never found out that love could be that strong
Losing him was blue, like I've never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
loving him was red
But loving him was red

Remembering him comes in flashbacks, in echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
when I still see it all in my head
Burning red

Losing him was blue, like I've never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
loving him was red
But loving him was red
And that's why he's spinning around in my head
His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead end street

"Listen dear
I need you to hear.
I cannot disappear
I've tried again and again and again.

I know we said
That we'd give up
You said we'd had enough
Again and again and again.

But you, you're always on my mind.
It's like this all the time.
Say it's cause you're mine

And if you will, I will
Try to let it go.
And if you try, I'll try
Try to let it show us the way
'Cause love is here to stay
Just look me in the eye
This is do or die
And I will stay in love
'Till you say enough
There is no giving in
There is no giving up in love.

Walk down the street
Stare at lots of things
The fast and steady streams
Again and again and again.

Do what I should
Try to stay busy
Your face is all I see
Again and again and again.

But you, you're always on my mind.
It's like this all the time.
Say it's cause you're mine
All mine...

Just look me in the eye
This is do or die
And I will stay in love

There is no giving up in love.

Like a movie I once saw
In the darkness I recall
Feeling the beauty and the pain
And when you call my name
Say you feel the same.

Cause' if you will, I will
Try to let it go
And if you try, I'll try
Try to let it show.

Just look me in the eye
This is do or die

There is no giving up in love

They hit me across the head with a billy club

Understand we're fighting a war we can't win
They hate us, we hate them

And now the empty hall

Hold me, fold me up in your arms
Faster, my love, sinking and gone

I talk alone, I talk now

And all the lights go out in empty rooms
And now the dirty hall

Wouldn't you want me to stay?

Rest your head and shut your eyes
Empty ambition
Blankets the sky

So drop the gown, the game's over
Just push your face into the fight

Ride so high, we both start thinking 'bout another world tonight
And it feels so wrong
Like nothing we've ever felt before

Takes you where you ought to be
In broken alleys, in the back of every street

Baby you can have it

Oh, baby, gnaw me
Down to the bone
Soon you'll find I'm never gonna take you back home
Well, there's so much you never told me
And there's not much I want to know
'Cause your pretty face will do just fine
You'll be the star
Of my very last show
Let's go for a long ride
I'll show you places you won't ever want to leave

The stranger's candy
Takes you where you ought to be
In broken alleys, in the back of every street

We could bring it all down

Dancing to the beat, but they'll never see this corpse

"I knew that I'd get like this again
That's why I try to keep at bay
Be a hundred percent
when I'm with you and then
A perfect heart's length away

The stickler is you've played
not one beat wrong
You never promised me anything
Even sat me down,
warned me just how they fall
And I knew the odds were I'd never win
And here I am

with you as my quarterback
A daft life

My self-worth measured in text back tempo
It's been 2 days and 8 minutes too slow
There may well be others
but I still like to pretend
that I'm the one you
really want to grow old with
You've got a schedule to stick to
Got a world to keep sweet
It's so much to everyone all the time
Will you ever slow down?
Will I ever come first?
The universe contracts decide

With you as my quarterback
A daft life
It's a half life
With you as my quarterback

You know you'll never be lonely
You know you'll always be loved
And maybe you'll never need more than that
Of the sad place that loves,
what's to become of us?
Does it even register on your conscience?
Along for one last showdown
From a box in the crowd,
air compressed tight to explode
I'm clenching my ticket to the only way out
As you disappear in a puff of smoke

Woman speaking in background (from ""Rip Van Winkle"" by Washington Irving):

""Times grew worse and worse with Rip Van Winkle as years of matrimony rolled on; a tart tempter never mellows with age, and a sharp tongue is the only edge tool that grows keener by constant use. For a long while he used to console himself, when driven from home, by frequenting a kind of perpetual club of the sages, philosophers, and other idle personages of the village, which held its sessions on a bench before a small inn, designated by a rubicund portrait of his majesty George the Third. Here they used to sit in the shade, through a long lazy summer's day, talking listlessly over village gossip, or telling endless sleepy stories about nothing. But it would have been worth any statesman's money to have heard the profound discussions that sometimes took place, when by chance an old newspaper fell into their hands, from some passing traveller. How solemnly they would listen to the contents, as drawled out by Derrick Van Bummel, the schoolmaster, a dapper learned little man, who was not to be daunted by the most gigantic word in the dictionary...""",1

"Strangers in my back yard
Selling you beliefs
Danger in my empire
Trouble on the streets

And I don't want to modernize
And I don't want to rearrange
I don't want to fix up
And I don't want to change

Hold on to the things that you love
Hold on to the things that you love
Hold on

Danger in the papers
Danger in the magazines
Sell you ideas
Sell you false dreams

And I don't want to modernize
And I don't want to rearrange
I don't want to fix up
And I don't want to change

Hold on to the things you can feel
Hold on to the things that are real
Hold on

Strangers in my back yard
Selling you beliefs
Danger in my empire
Trouble on the streets

And I don't want to modernize
And I don't want to change
I don't want to fix up
I don't want to rearrange

Hold on to the things you can feel
Hold on to the things that are real
Hold on to the things that you love
Hold on to the things that you love

Hold on to the things you believe
Hold on to the things that you see
Hold on to the one that you love
Hold on to the one that you love",3
"One Two Three Four
Tell me that you love me more
Sleepless long nights
That is what my youth was for

Old teenage hopes are alive at your door
Left you with nothing but they want some more
Oh~~oh~~
 you're changing your heart
Oh~~oh~~
 You know who you are
Sweetheart bitterheart now I can tell you apart
Cosy and cold, put the horse before the cart
Those teenage hopes who have tears in their eyes
Too scared to own up to one little lie
Oh~~oh~~
 you're changing your heart
Oh~~oh~~
 you know who you are
One, two, three, four, five, six, nine, or ten
Money can't buy you back the love that you had then

One, two, three, four, five, six, nine, or ten
Money can't buy you back the love that you had then

Oh~~oh~~
you're changing your heart
Oh~~oh~~
you know who you are
Oh~~oh~~
you're changing your heart
Oh~~oh~~
you know who you are~~~
Oh~~~~you are are~~are~~

For the teenage boys
They're breaking your heart
For the teenage boys
They're breaking your heart

"She's been gone since yesterday
Oh I didn't care
Never cared for yesterdays
Fancies in the air

No sighs or mysteries
She lay golden in the sun
No broken harmonies
But I've lost my way

She had rainbow eyes
Rainbow eyes
Rainbow eyes

Love should be a simple blend
A whispering on the shore
No clever words you can defend
They lead to nevermore

No sighs or mysteries
She lay golden in the sun
No broken harmonies
But I've lost my way

She had rainbow eyes
Rainbow eyes
Rainbow eyes

Summer nights are colder now
They've taken down the fair
And all the lights have died somehow
Or were they ever there?

No sighs or mysteries
She lay golden in the sun
No broken harmonies
But I've lost my way

She had rainbow eyes
Ooh

They've taken down the fair",2

"Fall is here, hear the yell
back to school, ring the bell
brand new shoes, walking blues
climb the fence, books and pens
I can tell that we're going to be friends
Walk with me, Suzy Lee
through the park and by the tree
we will rest upon the ground
and look at all the bugs we found
then safely walk to school
without a sound
Well here we are, no one else
we walked to school all by ourselves
there's dirt on our uniforms
from chasing all the ants and worms
we clean up and now its time to learn
Numbers, letters, learn to spell
nouns, and books, and show and tell
at playtime we will throw the ball
back to class, through the hall
teacher marks our height
against the wall
And we don't notice any time pass
we don't notice anything
we sit side by side in every class
teacher thinks that I sound funny
but she likes the way you sing
Tonight I'll dream while in my bed
when silly thoughts go through my head
about the bugs and alphbet
and when I wake tommorow I'll bet
that you and I will walk together again
cause I can tell that we're going to be friends
",1
"She said the sleepers on tracks have woken up
It's the end of the line I guess our luck is up
It was fun while it lasted cause nothing ever does
Love has lost its meaning and it was wasted on us
In the electrical storm you were running wild
You had a death wish you were a child
I came to bearing a lightning bolt
If you came back as the deep sea,
I would come back as the salt
It's like your head is stuck in a tightening vise
Your ears are deaf to your friends’ advice
Because you know that your heart will never be full
It doesn't always have to be beautiful
Unless its beautiful

Okay leave now leave now if you just can't stay
 Because there’s nothing worse than somebody pretending away
The years of their youth they will never get back
So I'll go home and practice the traits you said I lacked
Like listening to the thunder of your heart
And how with every other beat we grew further apart
Love is always going to be hard to you both
Never thinking that you'll ever love anyone else as much
But it’s ugly, it’s ugly now yeah I know
But you never give things enough time to grow
It's like driving through a carnival
It doesn't always have to be beautiful
Unless its beautiful

Baby I know it's over
Tell me (please) wait ‘til you're sober
Now we know it’s true
The waiting never quite felt like waiting when the waiting was with you
Baby I know it's over
Tell me (please) wait ‘til you're sober
Now we know it’s true
The waiting never quite felt like waiting when the waiting was with you

So let me tell you tell you a thing or two
About how to survive when there is a me and a you
It's awful, it's gruesome, it's something, it's cruel
Forever you will ask God if this happened to you
‘Cause I'm always thinking, thinking about where you are
Who you're with and if your mind is far
From what we do when we're alone
Love is to much for me and now the wall needs to grow

So when your head stuck in a tightening vise
Your ears are deaf to your friends’ advice
Because you know that your heart will never be full
It doesn't always have to be beautiful
Unless its beautiful
Baby I know it's over
Tell me (please) wait ‘til you're sober
Now we know it’s true
The waiting never quite felt like waiting when the waiting was with you
Baby I know it's over
Tell me (please) wait ‘til you're sober
Now we know it’s true
The waiting never quite felt like waiting when the waiting was with you

"Your eyes are blue like the ocean
And baby I'm lost out at sea
Did the sun just come out or did you smile at me
I've been trying to ask you but I can't seem to speak
Was it love at first sight 'cause I walked by last week
I'm singing Fa la la la la

Your lips look so lonely
Would they like to meet mine
You are the one that I've been hoping to find
You're so sweet that you
Put Hersheys out of business
Can I have a photograph to show my friends that
Angels truly exist I'm singing Fa la la la la

You're as cute as a button
The things you do sure are something
Are you running out of breath
From running through my head all night

Is there something in your eye, oh
wait, it's just a sparkle
Can you get a little closer
And help me out a little bit
I scraped my knee fallin' for you
But baby a kiss will do
I'm singing Fa la la la la la

You're as cute as a button
The things you do sure are something
Are you running out of breath
From running through my head all night
I'm falling in love and wouldn't I like to think so
And every night I look at the stars out my window
And I hope I can see
The one that we saw together
It was just you and me and honestly
I'll look for that star forever

I'm falling in love and wouldn't I like to think so
And every night I look at the stars out my window
And I hope I can see
The one that we saw together
It was just you and me and honestly

"By the last breath of the fourth winds blow
Better raise your ears
The sound of hooves knocks at your door
Lock up your wife and children now
It's time to wield the blade
For now you have got some company
The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On the leather steeds they ride
They have come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the four Horsemen ride
or choose your fate and die
You have been dying since the day
You were born
You know it has all been planned
The quartet of deliverance rides
A sinner once a sinner twice
No need for confession now
Cause now you have got the fight of your life
The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On the leather steeds they ride
They have come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the four Horsemen ride
or choose your fate and die
Time
has taken its toll on you
The lines that crack your face
Famine
Your body it has torn through
Withered in every place
Pestilence
For what you have had to endure
And what you have put others through
Death
Deliverance for you for sure
There is nothing you can do
So gather round young warriors now
and saddle up your steeds
Killing scores with demon swords
Now is the death of doers of wrong
Swing the judgment hammer down
Safely inside armor blood guts and sweat
The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On the leather steeds they ride
They have come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With the four Horsemen ride
or choose your fate and die

"Frozen in the place I hide
Not afraid to paint my sky with
Some who say I've lost my mind
Brother try and hope to find

You were always so far away
I know that pain so don't you run away
Like you used to do

Roses in a vase of white
Bloodied by the thorns beside the leaves
That fall because my hand is
Pulling them hard as I can

You were always so far away
I know that pain
So I won't run away like I used to do

Pictures in a box at home
Yellowing and green with mold
So I can barely see your face
Wonder how that color taste

You were always so far away
I know the way so don't you run away
Like you used to do",2
"So you dropped me
Held me by my feet and let me go
I fell between the seat, but nothing broke
I've yet to feel that brilliant afterglow
The one I knew of years ago
Now I'm twisted
Twisted from the waist and spun around
Promised only sky but given ground
Realized the makeup is for a clown
The clown I knew of months ago
I only wanted to be somebody
So fucking bad, I came unglued
I only wanted to be somebody
So here we are now, face to face
And I'm fucking you

So you caught me!
Wishing I were better than the rest
You hit me and left bruises on my chest
And when I wouldn't cheat
I spit upon your test
The test I tore up weeks ago
And now my fist is
My fist is for your face to cock the jaw
When I begin to rise, you start to fall
Now you know how it feels to drop the ball
The ball I threw back days ago
So I'll just stand right here for now

I should have won, but how?
I break a smart ass grin
Who let the loser win?
Let's break a smart ass grin
Let's let the losers win!

"Like you've been carrying a load

And you swear to me

You don't want to be my slave

But you're staring at me

Like I need to be saved  saved

In your jesus christ pose

Arms held out

In your jesus christ pose

Thorns and shroud

Like it's the coming of the lord

And I swear to you

That I would never feed you pain

But you're staring at me mine

Like I‘m driving the nails

Like I’m driving the nails

Like I‘m driving the nails...

In your jesus christ

jesus christ

jesus christ  start  line

And you stare at me

In your jesus christ pose

Arms held out like it's

The coming of the lord

And would it pay you more to walk on water

Than to wear a crown of thorns

It wouldn't pain me more to bury you rich

Than to bury you poor

"There is no ending to this life
That I've to live with endless sighs
Oh, can't you see I'm falling now?
Oh, could you hear these words somehow

But I can see the sadness in your eyes
And I can see the sadness in your smile

Hold me now
Heal my wounds
Hold me like you did

There is no ending to this life
That I've to live with endless sighs
And all I know is that my head is gone
And I am falling now

You don't love me anymore
You don't need me)

Trumpet blows in my heart
Sun goes down,
I come after you as soon as night falls
 
You threw a net over Commando,
Neither black magic nor black money will work Ra!

But try at least once with love

what’s in idle talk?
Fall in love Make promises

My heart is without heartbeat
Touch it and make it beat
Give me some relief
and some torment

Would she go down on you in a theatre
Does she speak eloquently
And would she have your baby
I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother

Cause the love that you gave that we made wasn't able
To make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me
Until you died, til you died
But you're still alive

And I'm here to remind you
Of the mess you left when you went away
It's not fair to deny me
Of the cross I bear that you gave to me

You seem very well, things look peaceful
I'm not quite as well, I thought you should know
Did you forget about me Mr. Duplicity
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner
It was a slap in the face how quickly I was replaced
Are you thinking of me when you fuck her

Cause the love that you gave that we made wasn't able
To make it enough for you to be open wide, no
And every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me you'd hold me
Until you died, til you died

And I'm not gonna fade

And every time I scratch my nails
down someone else's back

Like ice about to melt
You empty yourself of everything

The colour blinds your eyes
The flavour dulls your taste of anything
You try to break out
But some thing's just locked the door 

You'll get blue eyes
If you stand too close to him
And if I jump for help
You die inside your dream
I love you like you love me not
I love you like you love me not

You'll get blue eyes
If you stand too close to him
And if I jump for help
You die inside your dream
I love you like you love me not
I love you like you love me not

You'll get blue eyes
If you stand too close to him
And if I jump for help
You die inside your dream
I love you like you love me not
I love you like you love me not

And the air was alive
With piercing sound and burning skies
The horror did me good,
The magic was on my side

And hot and cold ideas
Were running onto your eyes
Your sinking grey eyes
She shook his head like so much meat
The horror did me good
Time to exercise",4
"Aight, man, whatever...

Spoken:
Dre, just let it run.
Hey yo, turn the beat up a little bit
Hey yo, this song is for anyone... fuck it, just shut up and listen
Hey yo

I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zags and this bag
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this... on this earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse

And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensin' these sentences gettin' this stress
That's been eatin' me recently off of this chest

And I rest again peacefully (peacefully)
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter

To not come and speak to me (speak to me)
I don't know you and no, I don't owe you a mo-therfuck-ing thing
I'm not Mr. *NSYNC, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick

If you tempt me my tank is on empty (is on empty)
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm liftin' you 10 feet (10 feet) in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me destroy you

Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of arguin' (of arguin)
I don't mean to be mean, but that's all I can be, it's just me

And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, ""Oh, it's his lyrical content.
That song ""Guilty Conscience"" has gotten such rotten responses.""

And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately
Points a finger at me (finger at me)
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinky

Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too
When a dude's gettin' bullied and shoots up his school

And they blame it on Marilyn (on Marilyn) and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see an upper class city

Havin' this happenin' (this happenin' )
Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way (rap this way)
But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
To burn and it's burnin' and I have returned

And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on ""My Name Is""

And pigeonholed into some poppy sensation
That copped me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience (got the patience)
To deal with these cocky caucasians

Who think, I'm some wigger who just tries to be black
'Cause I talk with an accent and grab on my balls
So they always keep askin' the same fuckin' questions (fuckin' questions)
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in?

The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
Till I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearin' it out (ahhh)
'Cause they drivin' me crazy (me crazy)
I can't take it, I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit

And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without someone standin' by it
No, I won't sign your autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am",3
"I was young, I was surviving the times
Waiting for my moment, I was destined to shine
Little Ray had an NSX, I was hoping I'm next
Wanting bracelets, never had a rope on my neck
Unless I was holding Taiyeh chain--Rest In Peace
Even though that night you flipped on us
You warned us If you came back and we still on the corners,
We goners, moving on to...
Move your arm in your watch To another time on the block
'Cause this 40 Side Where they say Shorty rhyme
Tragedy he used to come through all the time
I'm talking Juice Crew, not what the word define
He had a sister named Erin, for sure was fine
That was my first crush; I bought my first mic
I wrote my first verse, I was about nine
I was about mine, fantasize house-buying
Met Paul, he wore some big glasses
Him and Melquan took me where G Rap lived
I was happy, just getting some answers
I ain't even know what a record advance was
I'm seeing hoes sex in the studio bathroom
With rap dudes, thinking wow she moved me
Same girl then, right now's a groupie
Back then, she was like the star in the movie
Large jewelery and expensive Gucci
Next stop, Paid In Full posse recruits me
Knew they were some millionaires, their ropes were dookie
Eric B man looking like touch-it-he-shoot-me
You see, every time Ra didn't show
I get to record demos at attempts to blow
I wonder could they tell, how did they know
Sixteen years later, here I go

I'm with Akinyele in the street, trying to get us a deal
G Rap tried to get us to sign to Cold Chill
But Fly Ty didn't have the contract we wanted
Clark Kent just signed Das, he didn't want us
Russell said I sounded like G, the nigga fronted
Reef and Matty C offered me a little money
Shit a little funny, feel a little laughter
Rebel of Hip-Hop coming through a white rapper
My boy MC Serch nevertheless
Took me to Columbia, back then CBS
Chris Schwartz, RuffHouse, he was the best man
Now bugging because the label had just dropped Def Jam
Could you picture Russell needing a check, man
But he smart, he plotted a plan for Polygram
Life is ill, again life's a movie
Then, the roster's: Cypress Hill, Nas, and Fugees
Before I sold records, no promotion
The rap world like, what's all this commotion
Went plat', mad bottles I'm toasting
20/20 highsight, but how did they know then

Invincible, lyrical, miracle man, huh
But back to the matter at hand
'Cause ten years ago we all strived to be twenty-five
Some cats didn't make it alive
Dated some stars but respect their privacy
Copped mad cars, laying back in the driver's seat
Held myself down, just giving the will
Here I am, completed my whole record deal

How can we still succeed,
taking what we don't need?
Telling lies, alibis,
selling all the hate that we breed.
Supersize our tragedy!

Bought in the land of the free!
(The free!)

And we're all too blame,
We've gone too far,
From pride to shame,
We're trying so hard,
We're dying in vain,
We're hopelessly blissful and blind
To all we are,
We want it all with no sacrifice!

Realize we spend our lives living in a culture of fear.
Stand to salute; say thanks to the man of the year.
How did we all come to this?

It's greed that we just can't resist!

From pride to shame,
We're trying so hard,

We want it all.
Everyone wants it all with no sacrifice!

Tell me now, what have we done? We don't know.
I can't allow what is being done to tear it down,
Believe me now, we don't know just what
With our backs against the wall.

And now we're all too blame,
We've gone too far,
From pride to shame,
We're hopelessly blissful and blind
When all we need
Is something true
I do believe,
Don't we all?
Everyone, everyone,
We will fall.

We've gone too far,
From pride to shame,
We're trying so hard,
We're dying in vain,

And every time I see you in my dreams 
I see your face, it's haunting me

That soon your face will fade away

Better get away from me
Stay the fuck away from me!

"I'll be the lights and the soul of the party,
Follow the swarm of the bees to their honey!
You'll find the struts in the club like a pony,
And I'm not missing your love,
I'm not-not missing your love!
I'm stronger since September,
And it's affecting feeling better than ever!
You were a let down from what I remember,
And I'm not missing your love,
I'm not-not missing your love!

We're gon' keep on dancing, out on the floor,
We're gon' keep on drinking, give me one more!
Mahito let's go bar man stack em' in a row!

Don't need to attract a guy
To make me feel alive inside
It's fantasy I'm doin fine,
Without you,
The girls are goin out tonight
Get blinded by the city lights,
Everythin's gon' be alright,
Without you, without you, without you, without you, without you.
Ahahahahah, Ahahahahah, Ahahahahah!
Ooh Ooh oh oh

Yes it's you that's headin for a breakdown,
And I'm sorry sorry's not any use now!
Cause you're the best thing I can do without,
Cause I'm not missing your love,
I'm not-not missing your love!

I can smell the roses, the sun has come out,
I'm comin into focus, look at me now!
Zambuca at the bar, laser fire in my heart!

Don't need to attract a guy
To make me feel alive inside
It's fantasy I'm doin fine,
Without you,
The girls are goin out tonight
Get blinded by the city lights,
Everythin's gon' be alright,
Without you, without you, without you, without you, without you.

Bein single isn't lonely,
Raise a lighter if you're with me!

Don't need to attract a guy
To make me feel alive inside

Get blinded by the city lights,

"I saw a picture yesterday,
You know the one, we were laughing in the rain
Remember how it used to be,
Remember when you were still in love with me

But you turned away,
And I start to cry
I'm lost without your love
And I won't survive
Don't leave me alone tonight
I'm lost without your love and I won't survive

I can't believe that we are through
Is it someone else?
Have ya found somebody new?
'Cause I die inside every time I close my eyes
And imagine myself living without you

But you turned away
And I start to cry
I'm lost without your love
And I won't survive
Don't leave me
Alone tonight
I'm lost without your love
And I won't survive",1

Disconnected from choices we make

You're gonna be swept off your feet

I would like someone to make map
Mark my home and draw some lines that match
All of the reasons why
It can be like you said

You're gonna be swept off your feet

"Fulfill the promise that was made
Whether the world or god stops you
You will have to come to me
Fulfill the promise that was made
 
My thirsty eyes have called for you
The path of love has called for you
My dear, stop making me desperate
You will have to come to me
Fulfill the promise that was made
 
I've accepted I will have to leave my soul
But know that whenever you call for me
I will come to you
Fulfill the promise that was made
 
I won't endure an insult to my loyalty
I gave you my heart, I'll give you my soul also
If I've made a deal with love, there's no need to be anxious about it
You will have to come to me
Fulfill the promise that was made
 
As long as this moon and the stars twinkle
Our bond will not break
I will have to come
Fulfill the promise that was made
 
Our story written with your words
Will be recited by the world forever
Whatever punishment the world may give us
I will come to you
Fulfill the promise that was made
 
The world always tells me
No one returns back here
Let the world see this is untrue
You will have to come to me
Fulfill the promise that was made
 
I've attached much of the world to myself
I've spent my time making excuses
My heart has not found peace since being away from you
You will have to come
Fulfill the promise that was made
 
I've always come and I'll keep coming
I'll keep fulfilling the rituals of love
My love if you've given me forever then I need no other provisions
You'll have to come
Fulfill the promise that was made",2
"Baby, you got a bad bad mouth
Everything is poison that\'s coming out
Cheating, lying since the day you were born
Someone outta rinse it out with soap
Wash it out, wash it out, wash it out

No kind words are coming out of your mouth
Plenty goes in but nothing good comes out
Badmouth, sad mouth, you were an unhappy child
That doesn\'t make your lying tongue alright
Wash it out, wash it out, wash it out

Wash it out, wash it out, wash it out
Cos everything is poison
You\'ll be the unhappy one
Your lips taste of poison
You\'re gonna be left alone
The Life & Death Of Mr. Badmouth -- PJ harvey
When you told me every word you said
Came from voices talking in your head
Baby, I just think you\'re out for what you can get
Your badmouth has killed off everything we had
Wash it out, wash it out, wash it out
Wash it out, wash it out, wash it out
Your lips taste of poison
You\'ll be the unhappy one
Cos everything is poison
You\'ll be in the corner crying
Your lips taste of poison
You\'ll be the unhappy one
Your lips taste of poison
You\'re gonna be left alone

No doubt we could put it to a better use, oh my

You keep insisting that nobody showed you how to keep relationships, oh yeah
Your daddy made a real good try, oh my

It comes along and taps you on the shoulder
You fall the arms that now will hold ha

"I've been workin' this graveshift
and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship

and fly past the sky

I've been workin' this graveshift

and I ain't made shit

I wish I could buy me a spaceship

and fly past the sky
Man, man, man

If my manager insults me again
I will be assaulting him

After I fuck the manager up then
I'm gonna shorten the register up
Let's go back, back to the Gap
Look at my check, wasn't no scratch
So if I stole, wasn't my fault
Yeah I stole, never got caught
They take me to the back and pat me
Askin' me about some khakis
But let some black people walk in
I bet they show off their token blackie
Oh now they love Kanye, let's put him
all in the front of the store
Saw him on break next to the 'No
Smoking' sign with a blunt and a Marl'
Takin' my hits, writin' my hits
Writin' my rhymes, playin' my mind
This fuckin' job can't help him
So I quit, y'all welcome
Y'all don't know my struggle
Y'all can't match my hustle
You can't catch my hustle
You can't fathom my love dude
Lock yourself in a room doin' five
beats a day for three summers
That's a different world like three summers
I deserve to do these numbers
The kid that made that deserves that Mayback

So many records in my basement
I'm just waitin' on my spaceship, blaow
I've been workin' this graveshift

and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship
and fly past the sky

I've been workin' this graveshift

and I ain't made shit

I wish I could buy me a spaceship

and fly past the sky

Man, I'm talkin' way past the sky
Let's go, yeah
And I didn't even try to work a job
Represent the mob
At the same time thirsty on the grind
Chi state of mind
Lost my momma, lost my mind
+My life, my love+ that's not mine
Why you ain't signed?
Wasn't my time
Leave me alone, work for y'all
Half of it's yours, half of it's mine
Only one to ball
Never one to fall
Gotta get mine
Gotta take mine
Got a tech nine
Reach my prime
Gotta make these haters respect mine
In the mall 'til 12 when
my schedule wore headset nine
Puttin' known ass on shelves
Waitin' paitently I ask myself

Qhere I wanna go, where I wanna be
Life is much more than runnin' in the streets
Holla at 'ye, hit me with the beat
Put me on my feet
Sound so sweet
Yes I'm the same ol' G, same goatee
Stayin' low key, nope
Holler at God Man why'd
you had to take my folks?
Hope to see Freddy G., Yusef G
Love my G, Rolly G
Police watch me smoke my weed, count my G's

Got a lot of people countin' on me
And I'm just tryin' to find my peace
Should of finished school like my niece
Then I wouldn't finally wouldn't use my piece, blaow
Aw man, all this pressure
I've been workin' this graveshift
and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship
and fly past the sky

I've been workin' this graveshift
and I ain't made shit

I wish I could buy me a spaceship
and fly past the sky

I remember havin' to take the dollar cab
Comin' home real late at night
Standin' on my feet all damn day
Tryin' to make this thing right
And havin' one of my co-workers
say Yo you look just like

This kid I seen in the old Busta
Rhymes video the other night

Well easy come, easy go
How that sayin' goes
No more broad service, cars, and them TV shows

I all had that snatched from me
And all the faculties all turn their back on me

And didn't wanna hear a rap from me
So naturally actually had to face things factually
Had to be a catastrophe with
the fridgest starin' back at me
Cuz nothing's there, nothing's fair
I don't wanna ever go back there
So I won't be takin' no days off 'til
my spaceship takes off

I've been workin' this graveshift
and I ain't made shit
I wish I could buy me a spaceship

and fly past the sky

I've been workin' this graveshift

and I ain't made shit

I wish I could buy me a spaceship

and fly past the sky

I wanna fly, I wanna fly

I said I want my chariot to pick me up
And take me brother for a ride

"My dad came into my room holding his hat
I knew he was leaving
He sat on my bed told me some facts
Son, I have the duty, calling on me
You and your sister be brave my little soldier
And don't forget all I told ya
You're the mister of the house now remember this
And when you wake up in the morning give yer momma a kiss
Then I had to say goodbye
In the morning woke momma with a kiss on each eyelid
Even though I'm only a kid
Certain things can't be hid
Momma grabbed me
Held me like I was made of gold
But left her inner stories untold
I said, momma it will be all right
When daddy comes home, tonight

Whether long range weapon or suicide bomber
Wicked mind is a weapon of mass destruction
Whether you're soar-away Sun or BBC1
Information is a weapon of mass destruct
You're called Caucasian or a poor Asian
Racism is a weapon of mass destruction
Whether inflation or globalization
Fear is a weapon of mass destruction

Whether Halliburton, Enron or anyone
Greed is a weapon of mass destruction
We need to find the courage, overcome
Inaction is a weapon of mass destruction

The skin under my chin is exploding again
I'm getting stress from some other children
I'm holding it in
We taking sides like a politician
And if I get friction we get to fighting
I defend my dad he's the best of all men
And whatever he's doing he's doing the right thing
It's frightening, but it makes me mad
Why do all of these people seem to hate my dad?
And if that ain't enough now I get these spots
I go to sleep every night with my stomach in knots
And what's more, I can hear momma next door
Explore the radio for reports of war
And all we ever seem to do is hide the tears
Seems like daddy been gone for years
But he was right, now I'm geared up for the fight
And he would be proud of me
My daddy came home tonight
Listen real keenly

Whether long range weapon or suicide bomber
Wicked mind is a weapon of mass destruction
Whether you're soar-away Sun or BBC1
Information is a weapon of mass destruct
You're called Caucasian or a poor Asian
Racism is a weapon of mass destruction
Whether inflation or globalization
Fear is a weapon of mass destruction

Whether Halliburton, Enron or anyone
Greed is a weapon of mass destruction
We need to find the courage, overcome
Inaction is a weapon of mass destruction

My story stops here, lets be clear
This scenario is happening everywhere
And you ain't going to nirvana or far-vana
You're coming right back here to live out your karma
With even more drama than previously, seriously
Just how many centuries have we been waiting for someone else to make us free?
And we refuse to see
That people overseas suffer just like we
Bad leadership and ego's unfettered and free
Who feed on the people they're supposed to lead
I don't need good people to pray and wait
For the lord to make it all straight
There's only now, do it right
'Cause I don't want your daddy, leaving home tonight",4

Loneliness is tragical

Got nothing to hide no more

blended in perfection
from the reels of this record that I've found.
Every day there's a boy in the mirror asking me:
What are you doing here?
Finding all my previous motives
growing increasingly unclear.
I've traveled far and I've burned all the bridges
I believed as soon as I hit land
all the other options held before me,
would wither in the light of my plan.
So I'll lose some sales and my boss won't be happy,
but there's only one thing on my mind
searching boxes underneath the counter,
on a chance that on a tape I'd find:
a song for someone who needs somewhere to long for.
Homesick.

The penny-drop that broke her arm
The monkey bars that you fell from
The swingset chain that stuck with my tongue
It's thirty below and we're far gone
If you plant yourself here I wouldn't miss you for long

I'm back to the way I was when you weren't around
If you want to know what that was like
I'll tell you first, it was way too quiet
It rained a hundred nineteen days of the year
I spent my time falling down the stairs
I know I can't tie you to a leash
But something tells me you'd go further than Greece
And then I'll have to figure out what to do

You could see it when you drive
There's a rooftop deck where we still hang out
A couple of bars where we're not allowed
The roller-skates that threw you on your face
The park on the hill which was our only space
The fog is fast and it rolls right in
About the time I struck my first fifth of gin
I really don't mean to complain too much
But this is turning me into quite the lush
I'm freaking out that we're running out of time
But to do what?
Should I stop and think of that?
Is there something I could do to slow it down?
Live in a day for once
Instead of watch it screaming by
You're a dandelion seed

Could feed the others
But we smother each other
With the nectar and pucker the sour
Of sugar sweet weather
blows through our trees
Swims through our seas

With my own cold, dead face
with my own wooden case

Too serious, too soon
I wanted you to love me

Now I'm Staring at the moon
Thinking ,we got too serious, too soon
Too soon
It's not right
It's not fair
It's in you baby cuts like a knife
what if you were the love of my life
Too serious, too soon
I wanted you to love me
I wanted to be there for you like no one else before
Too serious, too soon
I wanted you to love me

"Evenings, as if they're mad,
nights like some tunnel..
I don't know why on rebel flights only,
O God, my heart comes..
O God, my heart is interested..
 
There is a question about tomorrow,
[as in, no one knows what happens tomorrow]
Living life is now.
I don't know why in nomadic ways only
I find my heart interested, O Lord,
my heart is interested..
 
My philosophy is - my bag is on my shoulders.
I go wherever the path takes me..
Not on the drops,
But the sea of drops itself..
 
O God, O God.. O God..",1
"She wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet was the night
Softer than satin was the light
From the stars

She wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet were her eyes
Warmer than May her tender sighs
Love was ours

Ours a love I held tightly
Feeling the rapture grow
Like a flame burning brightly
But when she left
Gone was the glow of blue velvet
But in my heart there'll always be
Precious and warm, a memory
Through the years
And I still can see blue velvet
Through my tears

One more night

I've been trying for so long, to let you know,
Let you know how I feel
So if I stumble and if I fall, just help me back,
So I can make you see

Give me that one more night
Oh one more night,
'Cause I can't wait forever

Please give me one more night,
Just give me that one more night
Oh one more night,

Just staring at the phone

I will always be with you
And if you sailed away
I would follow you

To give me one more night,
Just give me that one more night
One more night,
'Cause I can't wait forever

I know there'll never be a time
You'll ever feel the same
And I know it's only words
But if you change your mind,
You know that I'll be here
And maybe we both can learn

Ah give me just one more night,
Give me that one more night
Just one more night,
'Cause I can't wait forever

Just give me one more night,
Oh give me that one more night
Just one more night,

This is really happening
You never looked so bored
Can you feel my fingernails?
They've never been so short

It's hard to lay a golden egg
with everyone around
It's hard to stay inside my head
when words keep pouring out

we'll lose our feathers

It gets better, it gets better
It gets better, we'll get better
It gets better, it gets better
It gets better, we'll get better

It's never been so warm
So can we kick the covers off?
They're always on
It's never been so warm

It's hard to keep a straight face
when I just wanna smile
If you could see the look that's in your eyes

Like starlight crashing through the room,
we'll lose our feathers
Yes, I know it hurts at first but it gets better
It gets better, it gets better
It gets better, we'll get better
It gets better, it gets better
It gets better, we'll get better

There's a fire in sky
Some snow on the ground
Not quite enough cigarettes
To calm me down

What have we done, oh my god

It gets better, we'll get better

"I know you need a friend
Someone you can talk to
Who will understand what you're going through
When it comes to love
There's no easy answer
Only you can say what you're gonna do

I heard you on the phone
You took his number
Said you weren't alone, but you'd call him soon
Isn't he the guy
The guy who left you cryin'
Isn't he the one who made you blue
When you remember those nights in his arms
You know you've gotta make up your mind
- Chorus -
Are you gonna stay with the one who loves you
Or are you going back to the one you love
Someone's gonna cry when they learn they've lost you
Someone's gonna thank the stars above

What you gonna say when he comes over
There's no easy way to see this through
All the broken dreams
All the disappointments
Oh girl -- What you gonna do
Your heart keeps sayin' it's just not fair
But still you've gotta make up your mind

Are you gonna stay with the one who loves you
Or are you going back to the one you love
Someone's gonna cry when they learn they've lost you
Someone's gonna thank the stars above

Tears we've cried are flood
Got all kinds of poison in
Of poison in my blood

I took my feet to Oxford street
Trying to right or wrong
Just walk away those windows
But I can't believe she's gone

When your still waiting for the snowfall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

A group of candles on me are flickering
Oh they flicker and they flow
And I am up here holding on to all those chandeliers of hope
And like some drunken in this city
I am go singing out of tune
Singing how I always loved you darling
And how I always will

But when your still waiting for the snowfall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

Those Christmas Lights
Light up the street
Down where the sea and city meet
May all your troubles soon be gone
Ohh Christmas Lights keep shining on

Those Christmas Lights
Light up the street
Maybe they bring here back to me
Then all my troubles will be gone
Ohh Christmas Lights keep shining on

Ohh

Ohh Christmas Lights
Light up the streets
Light up the fireworks in me
May all your troubles soon be gone
Those Christmas Lights keep shining on

But I wanna go home

Maybe surrounded by
A million people I
Still feel all alone
I just wanna go home
Oh I miss you, you know

And I've been keeping
all the letters that I wrote to you
Each one a line or two
I'm fine baby, how are you
Well I would send them but
I know that it's just not enough
My words were cold and flat
And you deserve more than that

Another aerorplane
Another sunny place
I'm lucky I know
But I wanna go home
Mmmm, I've got to go home

Let me go home
I'm just too far from where you are
I wanna come home

And I feel just like
I'm living someone else's life
It's like I just stepped outside
When everything was going right
And I know just why you could not
Come along with me
But this was not your dream
But you always believe in me

Another winter day has come
And gone away
And even Paris and Rome
And I wanna go home
Let me go home

And I'm surrounded by
A million people I
Still feel alone
Oh, let go home
Oh, I miss you, you know

Let me go home
I've had my run
Baby, I'm done
I gotta go home
Let me go home
It will all right
I'll be home tonight
I'm coming back home

"Painted as a victim
He said you caused it all
Lying to convince them
So you would take the fall
You walked out on nothin'
Hoping for some peace of mind
The pain is almost over
The hurt is nearly gone
No more looking over your shoulder
It's time to carry on
Scars won't last forever
The truth will take their place
Angry words will be forgotten
Contempt will fade away
The promise of tomorrow
It will always remain
The pain is almost over
The hurt is nearly gone

I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
and now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out

Nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention
I reckon its again my turn to win some or learn some
But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait  I'm yours

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and damn you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love love love love
Listen to the music of the moment people  dance and sing
We're just one big family
It's your God-forsaken right to be loved love loved love love

But do you want to come on
Scooch on over closer dear
And i will nibble your ear

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
but My breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and laughed
I guess what i'ma saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue
But I won't hesitate no more  no more
It cannot wait I'm yours
Open up your mind and see like me (I won't hesitate)
Open up your plans and damn you're free (No more, no more)
Look into your heart and you'll find the sky is yours (It cannot wait, I'm sure)
So please don't, please don't  please don't (There's no need to complicate)

"We were sitting in our backyard,
Waiting for the stars to show.
But the city lights shine too far
On and on the grey skies glow.

Took my bike out on Harvard Street,
Rode up Atlers to Saint Clair,
Started countin' cars surrounding me,
My lungs burstin' for some cleaner air.
It was sadder than the morning doe,
Much funnier than a clown.
But when push comes to shove,
Oh, I still love this town.
Do do do do
Do do do do
Do do do do do do do do

I was waitin' on the eastbound train,
Headed out to see the suburbs,
When I thought I heard my name.
It was just a crazy lady slurrin' words.
It was sadder than a weepin' willow.
As silly as a dog with a bone.
But when you ask me 'bout it,
I'll still call this my home.
Do do do do
Do do do do do do do do
Oh oh
Do do do do

Early mornin' on a Saturday,
The bustle wakes us up in bed.
Construction, trucks, kids in the park at play,
No quiet place to lay our heads.

I was crazy as the Cheshire Cat,
But when we get to the heart of the matter,
This is where I'll hang my hat.

Coz she’s so right for me, (oh-oh)

He’s always hated me,
Coz I never got, a j o b

Coz she’s mine,

And ran away and hid
But it's the best thing I ever did.
Coz true love lasts forever
And now we’re back together
As if he never met her
So looking back,
I'm glad i crashed the wedding

The neighbours spread the word,
and My mom cried when she heard,
I stole my girl away,
From everybody gathered there that day.
just in time,
And I’m glad i crashed the wedding,
Its better than regretting,
I could have been a loser kid
And ran away and hid
I said I'd do it and I did.

And now we’re back together
As if he never met her
So looking back,
I'm glad i crashed the wedding

don't waste time being
Mad at me for taking her away, coz
Anyway she didn’t want to stay.
So please believe me when I say
She's glad I crashed the wedding
It's better than regretting

The ring she got was lame
She couldn't take the pain
She didn't want a silly second name
Cause true love lasts forever (true love lasts forever)
And now we're back together
You might as well forget her
And walk away
She's glad I crashed the wedding
It's better than regretting (it's better than regretting)
The ring she got was lame
She couldn't take the pain
She didn't want a silly second name (no no no no)

So I call your name, cross my fingers
uncross the others, hesitate.

And you can take all your things;
the boxes and rings
and get going.

Let it be, and come to me with the look in your eyes.

Just to feel a little better about myself
And I do, baby I do.
'Til their lips start to move,
and their friends wanna talk music
I say ""I've never heard the tune!""
But I have, I just hate the band
'cause they remind me of you.

When all the pretty girls can't measure to you?

I don't understand your reasons
Please just stay over the weekend
You can't take all those things
They define you and me

You're all that I need
Please don't make me face my generation alone.

"Catch your breath,
Hit the wall,
Scream out loud,
As you start to crawl
Back in your cage
The only place
Where they will
Leave you alone.
'Cause the weak will
Seek the weaker till they've broken them.
Could you get it back again?
Would it be the same?
Fulfillment to their lack of strength at your expense,
Left you with no defense;
They tore it down.

And I have felt the same as you,
I've felt the same as you,
I've felt the same.

Locked inside
The only place
Where you feel sheltered,
Where you feel safe.
You lost yourself
In your search to find
Something else to hide behind.

The fearful always preyed upon your confidence.
Did they see the consequence,
When they pushed you around?
The arrogant build kingdoms made of the different ones,
Breaking them till they've become just another crown.

Refuse to feel anything at all,
Refuse to slip,
Refuse to fall.
Can't be weak,
Can't stand still,
You watch your back 'cause no one will.
You don't know why they had to go this far,
Traded your worth for these scars,
For your only company.
And don't believe the lies
That they have told to you. Not one word was true
You're all right, you're all right, you're all right.",2
"I see them gathered see them on the shore
I turned to look once more
And he who knows me not takes me to the belly of darkness

Even the comfort of a stone would be a gain

I would have to give up
But I'm thankful that I'm
Strong as I am and I'll try to do the best I can

Tears will run swift and tears will come that fall like rain
I pray that it's swift though tears will fall as cold as pain

I pray to the almighty
Let me not to him do
As he has unto me
Teach my beloved children
Who have been enslaved
To reach for the light continually

So many times I prayed
So many times I've prayed
For you
Prayed for you
The tears run swift and hard and cold as pain
Even the comfort of a stone would be a gain
Had I not the strength and wisdom of a warrior
I would have to give up
But I'm thankful that I'm strong as I am
And I'll try to do the best I can

Tears will run swift and tears will come that fall like rain
I pray that it's swift though tears will fall as cold as pain

I pray to the almighty
Let us not do as he has unto us
Teach my beloved children
I've been a slave
But reach for the
Light continually

Wisdom is the flame
Wisdom is the brave warrior who will carry us into the sun
I pray that it's swift though tears will come that fall like rain

I said it cause I can
Today I don’t feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don’t feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
Cause today I swear I’m not doing anything
Nothing at all
Nothing at all

Tomorrow I’ll wake up do some P90X
Meet a really nice girl have some really nice sex
And she’s gonna scream out “this is great”
(Oh my god, this is great)
I might mess around and get my college degree
I bet my old man would be so proud of me
But sorry pops you’ll just have to wait
Yes I said it
I said it
I said it cause I can
Today I don’t feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don’t feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
Cause today I swear I’m not doing anything

No I ain’t gonna comb my hair
Cause I ain’t going anywhere

I’ll just strut in my birthday suit
And let everything hang loose

Today I don’t feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don’t feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
Cause today I swear I’m not doing anything
Nothing at all
Nothing at all
Nothing at all

"Untouchable like a distant diamond sky
I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why

I'm caught up in you
I'm caught up in you

Untouchable Burning brighter than the sun
And when you're close I feel like coming undone
In the middle of the night
When I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Little taste of heaven

It's half full and I won't wait here all day
I know you're saying that you'll be here anyway

But you're untouchable
Burning brighter than the sun

Spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on

I wanna feel you by my side
Standing next to me

"Through acrid clouds of summer flies
The garden swells with a thousand more wise
Forever flung to celestial dreams
Clawing at the grave of the dead Nazarene

I watch the storm approaching
The darkness calls my name
The trees are growing restless
They feel the season change
Their fruit has putrefied
Forbidden once and bound to die
The thread of life lies severed
On the brink of paradise

Grinning winds of hate unfurled
Towers tall that grip the sun
Talons stretch 'neath her veil
Reclamation, our time has come
Our time has come

Autumn spreads its golden wings
And lays the path for those unseen
A tangled web of evil spun at last
Winter spawn from barren thighs
To readdress, to slay the blind
And throw the reins untethered to the skies

They pray to the full moon rising
Diana moving with such infinite grace
Wrapped alone in a blanket of nightfall
How many secrets can they read by your face?

Will they know of majesty
Of beauty held in dream-dead sleep
And scarlet seas that bleed the frozen shores?
Will their God of bridled love
Assuage our rule from planes above
Or shrink in fear from chaos roused for war?

War!

Wrest askew the nails
That have held you, lurking deep
September prayers are waning
Burn the shrines of fettered sheep
Spearhead the insurrection
Of a world that seeks no end
We are what we are, what we shall be, again
Again

Appear; draped in terror
To the comfort of your kin
Stain the milky sunset red
And let the others

Summer's dying",2
"Sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak
When you feel weak, you feel like you just wanna just give up
But you gotta search within you, try and find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of you, and get that motivation not to give up
And not be a quitter no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face.

Till I collapse Im spillin these
raps long as you feel em
Till the day that I drop youll never say that Im not killin em
Cuz when I am not, then Ima stop pinnin them and I am not
hip-hop and Im not just Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when Ima stop sendin
em, women are caught in webs, spin em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not
Get the illin to stop, amoxacillins just not real enough
The criminal cop killin hip-hop villiana
Minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
Your comin with me, feel it or not youre gonna fear it
Like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot lyrics to shock,
Is it a miracle
Or am I just a product of pop fizzin up?
Fa shizzel my wizzel, this is the plot
Listen up,
You bizzels forgot slizzel does not give a  fuck 
Till the roof comes off,
Till the lights go out
Till my leg give out
Cant shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out
And my high burn out
Ima rip this shit till my bone collapse
Till the roof comes off
Till the lights go out
Till my legs give out
Cant shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out
Am I high, perhaps?
Ima rip this shit till my bone collapse

Music is like magic, theres a certain feelin
You get when youre real,
And you spit and people are feelin ya shit
This is your moment and every single minute
You spend trynna hold on to it
cuz you may never get it again
So while youre in it try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over
Just admit when its at its end
Cuz Im at the end of my wits with half the shit gets in
I got a list
Heres the order of my list that its in 
It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie
Andre from Outkast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me
But in this industry, Im the cause of a lotta
Envy
So when Im not put on this list
The shit does not offend me
Thats why you see me walkin around like nothins
Botherin me, even though half
You people gotta fuckin problem with me
You hate it but you know respect you got to
Give me
The press wet dream like
Bobby and Whitney
Nate hit me
Till the roof comes off,
Till the lights go out
Till my leg give out
Cant shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out
And my high burn out
Ima rip this shit till my bone collapse
Till the roof comes off
Till the lights go out
Till my legs give out
Cant shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out
Am I high, perhaps
Ima rip this shit till my bone collapse

Soon as a verse starts I eat at an Emcee's
Heart, what is he thinkin', how
Not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my
Spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth
That would be the death of me first
'cuz in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could
Ever be worse that's why I'm
Clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like
I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack,
Like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full blown attack I'm launchin'
On them, the track is on some
Battlin' rap who wants some static
'Cuz I don't really think that the fact that
I'm Slim matters
A plague and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest so
Till the roof comes off,
Till the lights go out
Till my leg give out
Can't shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out
And my high burn out
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse
Till the roof comes off
Till the lights go out
Till my legs give out
Can't shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out
Am I high, perhaps?
I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse

Until the roof, (Until the roof)
the roof comes off (The roof comes off)
Until my legs, (Until my legs)
give out from underneath me,
I, I will not fall,
I will stand tall
Feels like no one can
beat me

"I am Iron Man

Has he lost his mind?
Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all,
Or if he moves will he fall?
Is he alive or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?
We'll just pass him there
Why should we even care?

He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
When he traveled time
For the future of mankind

Now the time is here
For Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved

Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfurl

Nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now he has his revenge

Heavy boots of lead
Fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can
Iron Man lives again!",4
"Really wish I could.

If only someone could unbreak my heart
Come relieve my pain
Somehow I could wish upon a star
And make all of the memories go away,

But my mind just keeps on going back
And I can’t help but think about
That guy that’s gon make me miss out on you
And I can’t help but remember
About that sad day in September
The day he took my heart with him when he left.
Ohhhhh.

See eventually I will get through this,
But right now it seems my heart’s in the way.
I apologize of the way that I treat you
But I gotta leave you,
Unless I come across a case of amnesia, amnesia, amnesia.
(to forget, to forget, to forget the heartache)
Amnesia, amnesia, amnesia.

Amnesia, amnesia, amnesia.

I gotta leave ya I gotta leave you.

I tryed to leave the past behind me
But it just hurts so bad. Ohhh.
And I tell myself please don’t cry,
Let it go and let the past be the past.

But my mind just keeps on going back
And I cant help but think about
That guy that’s gon make me miss out on you.
And I can’t help but remember about that sad day in September
When ya took my heart and just ran away! ohhh

Everytime you try to get closer to me
I’m fallin back cuz I can’t go down this road again
Memories won’t go away
Constantly in control of my life
I don’t wanna erase it all
And forget about it all!

I'm a here to stay,

I'm here to stay.

"Beauty queen of only eighteen
She had some trouble with herself
He was always there to help her
She always belonged to someone else

I drove for miles and miles
And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times but somehow
I want more

I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
she will be loved
She will be loved

Tap on my window knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
It doesn't matter anymore

It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along
My heart is full and my door's always open
You can come anytime you want

I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
She will be loved
She will be loved
She will be loved
I know where you hide
Alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls

Tap on my window knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful

I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile
And she will be loved
She will be loved
She will be loved
She will be loved

"In my eyes it remains, with each breath it returns
Your face
It is painted on each wall of my heart
Your face
Only you exist, you are my world
You are the Lord, you are my prayer
You are my lips, my tongue
You are my path, my abode
You are my guide
 
Such is my state without you
As the moon is incomplete without a sky to adorn
Take your place within my heart
Only then will this companionship be complete
 
Your love has given me fame
I have shattered in your arms
 
I see in the dawns and dusks
Your face
I see in the sunlight and in the shadows
Your face
 
Glimpse into your heart
And you shall find our love
Ask not the state of my anguish
I cannot spend moment now without you
 
In all my embraces and on all my paths
I see your face
Everytime I sigh, wherever I seek refuge
I see your face",4
"I tried it, I couldn't find it
Now I just wanna get back to me
Oh baby, hoo hoo
Back into the man I used to be

Things that I said I wouldn't do, I did 'em
Secrets below the service of truth I hid 'em
This man kind is past, but can he erase
The tears of a million years is human race
Of animals, that talk and walk upright
Then slave all day and fall in a trance at night
Flowing the planet, trying to find missing links
Like the men we used to be and always suppose to think
Mysteries, maybe not
It's getting hot, we better configure the plot, but
I hold a pen with the grip so tight
That'a squeeze the ink out'ta the page, and write a song for the people
Came up from the underground, now I write above on a hovercraft sound
This microphone, like an an amphetamine
Keeping me clean, speaking in dreams
So nature can intervene, just for a scene

I tried it, I couldn't find it
Now I just wanna get back to me
Oh baby, hoo hoo
Back into the man I used to be

I walk along this path alone, my feet hurt
Lost some friends along the way, I did dirt
I went to church, I tried everything
From leaving my body, to watching the birds sing
For hours, so I could feel heavenly powers
Had been across the universe and inside of flowers
But what is it worth, I'm still just a man on the earth
Rappers are acting like man tan
Can I be candid, I can't stand it
Rap bandit, got heaven acting frantic
I wanna swing my sword decapitate
But what is a man if he acts like an ape
So I sit back, planning my great escape
Load up my EPS and peruse my record crate
The man I used to be, I can only see by looking beyond me
So what is reality, I don't know

I tried it, I couldn't find it
Now I just wanna get back to me
Oh baby, hoo hoo
Back into the man I used to be

Wrong song
You know what
I woke up in the morning
I took a trip to the corner store
That's when I heard my calling
But I'd never heard the voice of truth before
So I kept on walking
Pretended I didn't see
Walked by a window and my reflection said to me
You could try all the same
But you'll never know this mystery
There's no pilot on your plane
So you're not the man you used to be
Try all the game, but you'll never know this mystery
When your pilot has no plane
Said you're the man you used to be seen
Holla and ya holla, you folla you fall
Ya holler and ya holla, you folla you fall
Ya holler and ya holla, you folla you fall
Ya holler and ya holla, you folla you fall
Ya holler and ya holla, you folla you fall
Ya holler and ya holla, you folla you fall
Yo, microphones get ripped holding us back
K dash rocking it out, rocking the cold style
Making it up, go along singing my song
Woke up, in the early morn didn't know what was going on
Whatever, I don't really know
Flows like an immaculate goat what up, whatever",2
"Yeah-yeah yeah-yeah yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah yeah-yeah yeah-yeah

I think I did it again
I made you believe
We're more than just friends
Oh, baby, it might seem like a crush
But it doesn't mean 
That I'm serious

'Cause to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Oh, baby, baby

Oops!...I did it again
I played with your heart
Got lost in the game
Oh, baby, baby
Oops!...you think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent

You see my problem is this
I'm dreaming away
Wishing that heroes they truly exist
I cried watching the days
Could you see I'm a fool 
In so many ways?

But to lose all my senses
That is just so typically me
Baby, oh

Oops!...I did it again
I played with your heart
Got lost in the game
Oh, baby, baby
Oops!...you think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent

Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah yeah-yeah

""All aboard""
""Britney, before you go, there's something I want you to have.""
""Oh, it's beautiful. 
But wait a minute, isn't this...?""
""Yeah, yes it is.""
""But I thought the old lady dropped it into the ocean in the end.""
""Well, baby, I went down and got it for you.""
""Aw, you shouldn't have.""

Oops!...I did it again to your heart
Got lost in this game, oh, baby
Oops!...you think that I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent

Oops!...I did it again
I played with your heart
Got lost in the game
Oh, baby, baby
Oops!...you think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent

Oops!...I did it again
I played with your heart
Got lost in the game
Oh, baby, baby
Oops!...you think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above

"Rip them down
Hold me up
Tell them that
I'm your gun
Pull my trigger
I am bigger than-

Mr. Prez in his big White House
Listen, he says, we're comin' out
Infiltration - we're numbin' your minds
Concentration - we've done time

Tell them that

Pull my trigger
I am bigger than-

Over there, the Queen, she says
Let's stamp them out and dry those tears
Saturation - we want in taxes
Flagellation - we've got gashes

Rip them down
Hold me up
Tell them that
I'm your gun
Pull my trigger
I am bigger than-

In the cold, the czar's claimin'
Just protectin', rockets aimin'
Alteration - earth is changin'
Observation - we want action

Rip them down
Hold me up
Tell them that
I'm your gun
Pull my trigger

I, the Emperor, proclaim
Us, the masters, we rule the game
Inclination - somethin' to dream on
Deprivation - we are sons

"It's way too late to think of
Someone I would call now
And neon signs got tired
Red eye flights help the stars out
I'm safe in a corner
Just hours before me

I'm waking with the roaches
The world has surrendered
I'm dating ancient ghosts
The ones I made friends with
The comfort of fireflies
Long gone before daylight

And if I had one wishful field tonight
I'd ask for the sun to never rise
If God leant his voice to me to speak
I'd say ""Go to bed, world""

I've always been too late
To see what's before me
And I know nothing sweeter than
Champaign from last New Years
Sweet music in my ears
And a night full of no fears

But if I had one wishful field tonight
I'd ask for the sun to never rise
If God passed a mic to me to speak
I'd say ""Stay in bed, world""
Sleep in peace

"Got no place to go
But there's a girl waiting for me down in Mexico
She got a bottle of tequila, a bottle of gin
And if I bring a little music I could fit right in

We got airplane rides
We got California drowning out the window side
We've got big black cars
And we got stories how we slept with all the
Movie stars

I may take a holiday in Spain
Leave my wings behind me
Drink my worries down the drain
And fly away to somewhere new

Hop on my choo-choo
I'll be your engine driver in a bunny suit
If you dress me up in pink and white
We may be just a little fuzzy 'bout it later tonight

She's my angel
She's a little better than the one that used to be with me
Cause she liked to scream at me
Man, it's a miracle that she's not living up in a tree

I may take a holiday in Spain
Leave my wings behind me
Drive this little girl insane
And fly away to someone new

Everybody's gone
They left the television screaming that the radio's on
Someone stole my shoes
But there's a couple of bananas
And a bottle of booze

Oh well, happy new year's baby!
We could probably fix it if we clean it up all day
Or we could simply pack our bags
And catch a plane to Barcelona 'cause this city's a drag

I may take a holiday in Spain
Leave my wings behind me
Flush my worries down the drain
And fly away to somewhere new

Take a holiday in Spain
Leave my wings behind me
Drive this little girl insane
Fly away to someone new
Fly away to someone new
Fly away to someone new

"every light in the night flicker in and out
every bone in my back shiver up and down
keep the pace just in case all the magic dies
cause this is drivin' me crazy

every freight train in my head make it stop and go
keep the pace just in case all the magic dies

this is love this is war its insanity
Dementia youre drivin' me crazy

(dementia youre drivin' me crazy

every tear in eyes dripped but wouldnt drop
every disc in my spine shook but couldnt stop
keep the pace just in case all the magic dies
cause this is drivin' me crazy
every hand let me go that i tried to hold
every warm hearted love left me freezing cold
keep the pace just in case all the magic dies
cause this is drivin' me crazy

through the skies you unravel at the speed of light
to realize there's chaos in the air tonight
